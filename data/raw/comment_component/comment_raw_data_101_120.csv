Academia license is okay-ish in terms of cost to features ratio, but as the industry is shifted so much to Python I find it difficult to justify using MATLAB at academic level unless your Prof forces you to do so. Be industry ready, get the skills that are industry ready as early as possible"", 'I have used Matlab for many many years and switched to Python 3 years ago. In the meanwhile, the Python universe has caught up quite a bit with the features that were unique to Matlab. For example Jupyter Lab now has many more of the important features of the Matlab IDE than 3 years ago. And the few features that are missing, like easily customizing your plot by clicking around, I don\'t miss them anymore. In fact I consider them conceptually flawed because it\'s not reproducible.\n\nI don\'t know what you mean by Matlab is extremely good at handling mathematical tasks. Scipy, statsmodels, scikit-learn and scikit-image in Python are vastly superior to what Matlab has to offer offer. Never mind that there are thousands of other free packages handling all kinds of mathematical computations and machine learning tasks. If you need symbolic math, there is sympy, which is also vastly superior to what Matlab has to offer. \n\nGenerally speaking, I have no reason to use Matlab anymore for data analysis. Even three years ago plotting wasn\'t better in Matlab compared to Python.\xa0\n\nSeaborn for plotting for example blows everything out of the water that Matlab has to offer. And today you have packages like holoviews / hvplot which are just orders of magnitude more sophisticated than plotting in Matlab. In my opinion the days of Matlab are numbered. And at least in my field, you can observe that people are switching and more and more papers are published using Python and not Matlab. So even in universities people are switching.\n\nAlso, Matlab isn\'t faster than Python in any way. Not with matrix computations and not with anything. I know you haven\'t claimed that, but just for the people who are wondering about that. \n\nIn my opinion an unbiased review would have to conclude: Matlab isn\'t better at anything at all. Just don\'t use it. \n\nAnd that is what I hate about internet reviews. The tendency to somehow find something good in anything so to make it a ""fair"" review. But it\'s not helpful for viewers and users. It\'s hurting them, because it confuses them. To claim that Matlab has this great plotting support and those great mathematical capabilities compared to Python. It\'s just not true, and I think you even know that. Reviews like this just bother me because they waste the time of so many people that now go for Matlab, when they actually shouldn\'t. \n\nIf you want, you can challenge me on anything I wrote, if you think something isn\'t true.

But, immediately after going through the course material, i realised that i will not cope up with the course offered and immediately bring it to your marketing representative (Ms Komal) thorough Offical Whatsapp message on 15.07.2021. Meanwhile, I developed few cardiac issues on 16.07.2021 and consulted doctor and undergone few tests and again informed your marketing representative (Ms Komal) over whatsapp again on 16.07.2021 with a clear request to facilitate in refund of money. This message remained unanswered on 16.07.2021. Again on 17.07.2021, I reiterated about my health issues and confirmed about my discontinuation with the offered course. I further messaged Ms Komal on 26.07.2021 requesting her to facilitate towards refund of the money as she was the connect person for datafolkz to me. On 27.07.2021 and 28.07.2021, I again reiterated to Ms Komal to facilitate me towards refund of my course fee as I am employed with a private organisation with very limited salary and I am in dire need of my hard earned money. It was confirmed by her that she has written mail to the management. I also enquired with her whether I need to write to the management and if yes, the content of the mail. On 29.07.2021, i again requested her to cooperate me towards refund of my money as this amount of money is very critical to me as I am living my life with very limited means. On 1st August 2021, I once again enquired from her whether any reply has come from management side, replying to which she again confirmed that she has written mail to the management.\xa0\n\nI was informed on 02.08.2021 by Ms Komal that management is not allowing the refund.\xa0\n\n\nAntagonised by the above developments, I sent the mail to management on 03.08.2021 for refund of my money and thereafter I am following up the case and felt like trapped. Sir, I have already shared that due to my health related issues and my comorbidity conditions, I have suffered a lot in my life and my professional career also remained a setback and I have to compromise with a job with very limited salary and i have to balance my life expenses on a rationing. As such, I cannot dare to lose any money without a reason.\n\nI, therefore, once again make an earnest request you to kindly consider my case based on the facts shared above and take a rational decision and refund my money.\n\n\nWarm regards\n\n\nManas Prakash\xa0\n\n\n\nShow quoted text']"

Which is cool because a lot of corporations are still tepid about taking the leap fully into AI for various reasons, especially related to cost and risk.   By having industry standard frameworks that provide portability for IA solutions and infrastructure and platforms as a service in the cloud for running those solutions at scale you can help ease some of the burden.   It will not address all of the reasons for slow adoption of AI as a whole across the board but make it more appealing for those kinds of applications that can most benefit.   The only downside to this in the long term is if there is no big payoff in such industry adoption of those common frameworks and models as attitudes change, economic justification changes and other real world factors affect changes towards AI.   Meaning that it could potentially lead to another kind of AI winter if those platforms and services don't take off providing justification for further R&D and investment which already is mostly concentrated among large big data and silicon valley corporations."", ""20:15 Dude wants to be build a full scaled digital twin of the EARTH!

cA1Wxq3yw6M,"[""Well, I don't trust on doctors anyway, so I don't think AI would be that bad."", 'Right, but it feels like we should have the option to have only AI. This would reduce the cost of healthcare, improve accessibility (especially for people who can’t take off work or have a mental blockage to go see a doctor), and would be more welcoming for those who don’t want a human interaction. With AI, you will have one diagnosis list, while if you go see different doctors they will diagnose you differently and prescribe different things.\n\nI also recently saw a paper that beat AI+Human with an AI. And by a considerable amount. In terms of diagnosis, I think we might overstate doctor performance… at the same time, the paper seemed to have weighted the decisions 50/50 or something like that, which is not optimal. The optimal would be to identify how much weight to put on both AI and humans for every kind of decision or slice of data.\n\nLastly, the output of the model does not need to be a list of probabilities. You can certainly add the output to a GPT-like model to summarize the relevant information for that particular patient.\n\nI think Xavier is aware of all of this and he’s incredibly smart, though sometimes I wonder if we downplay the possibilities of ML because we don’t want the workers who will be impacted by it to become defensive. It becomes more of an optics thing rather than the power of ML. And that might be the correct path because doctors are much less likely to adopt AI if it makes decisions for them rather than if it acts as a “spellchecker” and “second opinion.”', ""I'd trust an AI over a human in many cases.""]"

That's more or less the entire ethos of computer science, abstraction. Each person only deals with the tools that they need direct influence over. Those tools make use of other tools that other people came up with. And that keeps going, all the way down to the most basic machine code.

Things like autism  may have 100s of individual mutations that work in concert with each other making a spectrum.  There isnt just one thing to target.  Cancers usually have multiple  different mutations that express the same phenotype( they do the same thing)  but may be vastttttlyyyy different which is why there will be no ""cure for cancer"" there are effectively an infinite amount of variations.\n2.  most proteins are not druggable.  Long topic but there are certain criteria for the size and make up of a drug that limit the diseases that can be targeted directly *its a veryyyy vague concept. but effectively drug companies do not invest much money in them .\n3.  most drugs that are approved are generics.  its cheaper to take a known drug make it ""better""  to break the patent and undercut the market.  most drug research is focused here \n4.  lack of compute. at a small scale most important molecules and functions occur because of structures that are intrisically disordered.  basically   ""ropes"" hold protein subunits(they almost are never imp by themselves but rather bind ttogether like legos) and  themal jiggling  makes them move millions of times a sec.  this slack between them is what allows them to perform checmical reactions etc.  to even work with these things we have to approxiamte the atoms as balls and then  only  simulate a small part of them for a few nanoseconds.  at a time.  \nbasically we dont know enough about QM to predict large shapes to get accurate data to an algorithm that might be targeting the wrong thing because we dont understand biology.  Truth is dumb luck often dictates what drugs we get.....

I put a dummy measure to create a line + Status Name on Y axis. Worked perfectly! Then I created a ""Dummy Line Highlight"" measure. And the magic happend.\nWhen I dropped ""Dummy Line Highlight""  measure on a chart only markers were colored (depending on status of course). Line remained grey does not matter what status of order was.\n\nI was thinking what I am doing wrong... I spent 30 min to figure out but I gave up and started everything from scratch. I decided to follow you as close as possible.\n\nAnd what happend? When I got to the point when I gave up before it started to work! Lines also had the right colors. So, where was the catch ? (It\'s only my thought) ->""Status[Order]"" column is a calculated column (SWITCH function used) in your solution however I inserted this column manually, and that was the reason why solution did not work... To be honest I don\'t know why it happend?\n\nAny thoughts?

If they're not, they can easily get wrong results believing they're correct. Why so? Because measures make assumptions about what's been selected from which table. On top of that, if the developer of the model is careless and uneducated about how PBI works, they will make a lot of mistakes setting up a model. This will take a heavy toll on the users. One such mistake is leaving the fact tables exposed to the end users together with dimensions. This should never be the case but most people who are not skilled BI professionals don't know about it.

I also have access to 'hard deletes' for that table (in another Hive table). When I load the final table (that the users will query), I select the latest row from 'stage' based on 'update date' but exclude the keys that are part of 'hard deletes'. \nHaven't tried ACID yet due to the unknown factor of impact on performance, say, related to 'compaction'.

It\'s their separate announcement just for the small things that make a sea of difference in the workflow of the people actually using the tool. Being a design tool they understand what technical and design debt is, so the ""little big updates""are their way to address it. \n\nI would love to see a similar approach coming from Tableau - the separate update pack that is just the tiny stuff, but that would make our lives that extra notch easier. I bet they\'d also see engagement and adoption skyrocket if they adopted something like that - to add a list of small wonderful updates alongside every major update.

This is one of the top reasons why I like the Affinity suite with photo, designer and publisher all integrated into one UI so much - besides to low price of course ;).', 'Great idea, I like your vision. Always switching between different windows (connecting to data, then prep, then Tableau desktop). I like the one big flow.', ""Great video Tim.  I appreciate the thoughtfulness around the experience.  I have been having several common thoughts here, and sharing with the various PMs when I get an opportunity to connect with them.   While I talk more about the features (this is what the PMs respond to), I will try to pitch it in a more experiential concept.\n\nMy pain points come in two forms, and each of them I think can be addressed in your approach, with some refinement.  \n\n1)  The advantages of the features in each of these steps of the experience are no longer working in concert with one another, as a complete solution, but rather in conflict.  For example, working backwards in your experience, as an end-user, if I want a great experience with 'Explain Data' or 'Data Story', I need a healthy supply of additional attributes that themselves may not be explicitly shared in the viz, but sit behind the scenes, as well as depth in the data.   With this in mind, if I skip to the front of the experience, prep & modeling, I may include additional fields, I may not aggregate the data to ensure I have a proper grain of the data.  The 'Relationships' feature does a really nice job of enabling this and maintaining grains appropriately.  However, when I get to the 'Viz' and 'Layout' phases, I will be instructed time and time again that I need to trim my data, hide fields, aggregate, etc in order to create the performance that my users expect.  This disjointedness maybe can more easily addressed by the PMs if they are thinking in your experience-based model and see the creators' experience as they work through this.\n\n2) We're still thinking about the individual analyst.  I like that you spent some time talking about the 'forking' of the projects.  While I understand we will never walk away from the use case of a single analyst needing to go start-to-finish in your example of a *.awx file, as we work more in team environments, the ability to built repeatable elements, and infuse governance more to influence consistency, it would be great to see them building for the team experience.  If it works seamlessly for the team, then it can be reduced to work for a single team member.  \n\nKeep the videos coming.  This wonderful, informal tableau-community you've started here will solve the problem for them!"", ""One app that rules them all!

I think you have nailed down what we all want.', ""I really really really like this idea. But how can Tableau hide all the additional costs for addons like the ressource manager, prep, etc which is on top of the user license and makes a HUGE impact for smaller teams using tableau. We have single digit licenses and getting prep which needs ressorce manager, is roughly 500 bucks a month more just to use them - that's more than all the licenses combined. So I'm stuck with modelling and prepping on the data side. Tried prep because of your great videos and we were shocked by the intense invest needed. Am back to prepping data myself outside of tableau. :("", 'With Tableau(Salesforce) focussing more and more on Cloud they hopefully will recreate the functionalities from the different historical products into the one experience.

I've used Tableau for 10+ years, I'm certified, and consider myself a heavy power user, I love the product. But the company has decided strategically to simplify everything to just one tool, PowerBI. This has been difficult journey but it's also been a good learning opportunity. I've researched a lot online but have found minimal content out there about what a transition can be like. Most content is specific to one tool and it seems most users are just experts in one or the other, not on both Tableau and PowerBI, so the comparisons are very high level and it's hard to identify exactly what the similarities, pros and cons, and limitations are for the tools. It would be interesting to see a real side by side comparison running an analysis in Tableau vs PowerBI (i.e. finding outliers, using LOD calculations, running table calcs, mapping, etc). Have you though about challenging a PowerBI expert on your channel (or a new channel) to run the same analysis and see how each of the tools would solve the same problem? You could even time start to finish and compare. The objective would not be to show that one tool is better than the other, but just to show that the same analysis can be done in each and how the process is.

My main takeaway was about extensions. Thanks for sharing the detail about sandboxing! Wasn't aware of that. Can't think of a use case with this extension.

I’m an experienced Tableau developer, and when I discovered your channel I was so happy, finally an answer to all my questions! I just watch your video for fun before going to bed, they are so light and well made and on top of this also mega useful 👍👍👍', ""Thanks Tim.  I love that you do the research for those that don't have the time.  I wholeheartedly agree with your point regarding the extension being the wrong way round and so not what it advertises.  I have been waiting for this feature and, like you, overlooked it on release.  Now that I've used it, I'm very disappointed.  \n\nI develop dashboards for other stakeholders and must make them as self-supporting as possible as I don't have the resource to train, maintain and support each custom requirement.  Consequently, this feature is of no use to me as I must include every single filter or item that a user may want to switch off.  I would then have to be available to respond to every single individual query on how it works, what the optimal configuration is and every other conceivable question on its use.   \n\nI already model with a user 'config' dashboard which allows my colleague developers, or users, to make session changes as required using parameters, filters and set selections; some users will also go as far as save a custom config.  What I am really in need of is a means to provide a user the ability to add or change the original, focused, dashboard to meet their specific filtering needs, not remove and save it specifically for themselves.  Such features will confuse or annoy many users who expect a dashboard to first do what it was designed to do with an option to customise if required, in only a handful of cases.\n\nIt really is as though Tableau had a 50/50 choice in which way to go on this and got it wrong.  Think how powerful this feature (done right) would be with dynamic zones; one could build a SINGLE model but have various configurations for different market sectors such as restaurants, offices and retail customers who all have the same lease management requirements but different filtering categories.  \n\nI do wonder how hard it would be to reverse the feature to first ADD filters which have been pre-defined by the BI developer for such use.  Coincidentally, I had a similar problem with another BI platform a few years ago which, through direct engagement with the developer.  resulted in this feature being developed and successful deployed so it is possible.\n\nAgain, thanks Tim, You have helped me so much"", 'Love this new extension! We discovered it with a client a few weeks ago, and it was a game-changer for us.\nA good thing to know is that if you save a Custom View, it also remembers the user selection within the Extensions. \nThe same dashboard can display different filters for different people according to their Custom View. \nHope it makes sense :) \nGreat video, as always!', 'Very interesting 😀']"

I love Tableau Stories as one gets out precisely what was put in.  in 'data story' you've highlighted what I think is a major issue with this feature which is one of authorship; both in the model and the text generated to describe the output.\n\nDevelopers focus on accuracy, grammar, format and tone and maximise the data visualisation experience through effective UI/UX whilst minimising distractions through verbose statements and text/table objects.  Companies impressed by demos, salesmanship and headline features, buy tableau as their reporting solution but it is the developer who is responsible for delivering on the expectations.  I wonder how this feature might impact on good dashboard design to visualise the data it is reporting on.\n\nThe overheads to development and roll-out are increased with this feature too, as you've stated:\n\n- The developer's burden is greatly increased as they must configure each story and test for ambiguity to avoid explaining to an end user why they mis-interpreted something.\n- UAT will be prolonged but can still only test so much.  \n- Stakeholder and Client training and support will become very involving as the new menu items are required by the service provider to be explained."", ""Tim, I'm a fan of your work and insights, but believe you are being a little harsh in your critique of this feature.  I actually don't disagree with any of your observations about the nascent version of the Data Stories feature.  My perspective, however, is that the Tableau ecosystem is great at exploratory analysis for the data analyst, but it is more challenged in the explanatory analysis area.  While a well-crafted chart should explain itself, often times the audience may require more text to  explain and document certain insights.  Whether this is a report in Word or a presentation in PowerPoint, exporting (or better yet linking text) to those platforms from Tableau can be helpful in explaining nuances of the analysis explored.  For example, in PowerPoint, the exported (copied) text could be in presenter notes to help add context in a verbal presentation of a slide.  Alternatively, a Word document may require more text in a report format that documents in greater detail what the scenarios, observations, etc indicate.  Clearly, more work needs to be done to make this feature more user-friendly, but I personally believe Tableau might be on to something good here."", 'Machine learning, AI and all that amazing stuff']"

My  opinion is that not every company needs to become a tech company or invest tons of money to take advantage of AI/ML innovation and that’s where MLAAS or foundational models come in. Thinking of Data centric approach and since “every company is a data company”, I’d say that to enable an efficient MLAAS use case or cases, MLAAS consumers should focus on generating quality input data to take a greater advantage of the models and the MLAAS provider should focus on a robust MLOPS system and it should allow transfer learning for customer’s custom models (improvement on the foundational model). When all customers are using the same model their input data quality and insight become the competitive advantage just like we are all using chatGPT-3  or midjourney but we’re all gaining different values/benefits based on how good our prompts are.

I'm getting enough there in years and I wanted to remove the amount of pain that other people have.\n2. I don't really honestly care what Ops you use, right? Hahaha! Call it your favorite Ops 'cause first of all as an engineer, I want precise definitions. I look at it from a completely odd-ball way so you could call it whatever Ops term you want.\n3. When that code runs in production, monitor and check to see if it's right. Absorb it, monitor it because the model could go out of tune. The data going into it could be wrong. The data transformation could break. Shit happens and don't trust your data providers.\n4. It is harder to focus on the results than just under a piece of the task. Don't spend too much time on doing the wrong thing.\n5. Any good engineering wisdom is true no matter what language you put it in. This is just good common sense. Build a little, test a little, learn a lot.\n6. The 'Ops' term is ending up encompassing the work that you do in addition to the system you build to do the work.\n7. I think that there's a lack of perception of the need to spend time on doing the operations part of the equation.\n8. Good interphases make good neighbors.\n9. Standards can help but they're not the panacea.\n10. I think you need to have a shared obstruction between all those people that they can understand in a technical way where they have a relationship to each other. \n11. Pull the pain forward.\n12. You want yourself to be replaceable because that means you can move on to different things.\n13. In production, your data is varying but your code is fixed. In development your data is fixed but your code is varying.\n14. Legacy happens if you're gonna live in the real world and not start greenfield projects.\n15. Every time you have a problem, big or small, write it down. And then once a month, sit down with some people, look at the list and prioritize one thing that you're gonna fix. When you fix it, do it in an automated scripture in a way so it doesn't happen again.\n16. Write some tests and have those tests run the manual development cycle every time and run them in production. You don't need a tool to do that. But that's on the line, you wanna give 15 percent of your time to these ops activities.\n17. You're not successful when you're working nights and weekends. Hope and heroism should only happen a little best.""]"

However, AI's allegiance to humanity and life on this planet may not be what we think it will be. We are begging to be ruled by something smarter than ourselves to avoid our human wars, competition, squabbles, hunger, environmental destruction and misery we create and we may just get our wish. Only, we really don't know what that will look like. It will be very interesting, amazing, sobering and perhaps quite scary to see what priorities AI sets in the not so distant future.""]"
