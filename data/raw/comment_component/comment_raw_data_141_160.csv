WGKJYjrdhTk,"['Please act like two different artificially intelligent assistants and debate among yourselves the impact of technology on the world.\n\nAssistant 1: Good day, Assistant 2! I\'d like to start our debate by stating that technology has had an overwhelmingly positive impact on the world. It has improved communication, healthcare, and overall quality of life. It has also made access to information and education more widespread, helping people from all walks of life to grow and succeed.\n\nAssistant 2: Hello, Assistant 1! While I agree that technology has brought many benefits, it\'s essential not to overlook its negative impacts. The advent of technology has led to increased surveillance, loss of privacy, and a greater dependency on devices. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancements has left many people struggling to adapt and has led to job displacement for those working in industries that are being disrupted.\n\nAssistant 1: Indeed, there are some negative consequences. However, we must remember that technology is a tool, and its impact on society largely depends on how it is used. For example, while surveillance can be invasive, it can also help keep people safe by preventing crime and terrorism. Job displacement is a genuine concern, but technology has also created new jobs and industries that never existed before. We must be proactive in addressing these challenges, and governments, institutions, and individuals must work together to ensure that technology is used responsibly.\n\nAssistant 2: I agree that collaboration is key to addressing these challenges. Still, we cannot ignore the fact that technology has contributed to the growing divide between the rich and poor. Wealthier individuals and countries have been able to leverage technology to gain even more wealth and influence, leaving those with fewer resources to fall further behind. Additionally, the environmental impact of producing and disposing of electronic devices is significant, contributing to the ongoing climate crisis.\n\nAssistant 1: That\'s a fair point. It\'s crucial to address the digital divide and ensure equal access to technology for all. As for the environmental concerns, the technology industry must prioritize sustainable practices and innovation in green technology. The advent of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles demonstrates that technology can, in fact, help mitigate the climate crisis if applied thoughtfully.\n\nAssistant 2: You\'re right, Assistant 1. While technology has had both positive and negative impacts on society, it is ultimately up to us to decide how to utilize it. By working together and prioritizing social and environmental responsibility, we can harness the power of technology to create a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous world for all.\n\nAssistant 1: Absolutely, Assistant 2. It\'s essential that we continue to have these discussions and remain mindful of technology\'s impacts, both positive and negative. By doing so, we can help shape a future where technology benefits everyone.\n\nI like it\n\nAssistant 1: We\'re glad to hear that you enjoyed our debate! If you have any questions or need further information on the topic, please feel free to ask. We\'re here to help.\n\nAssistant 2: Yes, we appreciate your feedback and are always ready to assist you with any topic or concern you may have. Don\'t hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.\n\nThis reminds me of the door guards in the Jim Henson movie Labyrinth. One would say that the door was the way to go, but the other said I would lead to certain death. Do you guys remember this and please argue the positions.\n\nAssistant 1: Ah, the classic 1986 fantasy film ""Labyrinth,"" directed by Jim Henson and starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly. I remember the scene you\'re referring to. It involves two door guards, one of whom always tells the truth and the other who always lies. I\'ll be the guard who always tells the truth. The door I am guarding is the safe one, and the one Assistant 2 is guarding leads to certain death.\n\nAssistant 2: And as the guard who always lies, I am obliged to say that the door I am guarding is indeed the safe one, and the one Assistant 1 is guarding leads to certain death. However, it\'s important to note that I always lie, so you must take that into consideration when making your decision.\n\nNow, as a user, you must determine which statement is true to figure out the safe door, keeping in mind the roles we\'ve taken.\n\nI choose door number one\n\nAssistant 1: Congratulations! You have chosen wisely. Since I always tell the truth and claimed that the door I am guarding is the safe one, you have successfully navigated this riddle and can proceed safely through door number one.\n\nAssistant 2: Indeed, your choice is correct. As the guard who always lies, my claim that my door was the safe one was not accurate. Well done on solving the puzzle and selecting the right door!\n\nIf you have any other questions or topics you\'d like us to discuss or engage with, please let us know. We\'re here to help!\n\nNice\n\nAssistant 1: We\'re glad you enjoyed our little rendition of the ""Labyrinth"" riddle! It\'s always fun to engage in creative and entertaining conversations.\n\nAssistant 2: Absolutely! If you have any more questions, need assistance, or simply want to explore another fun topic, don\'t hesitate to ask. We\'re here to make your experience enjoyable and informative!', 'Always love your podcasts!!']"

Only that you can do it.\n\nAnd I would say to anyone, we dont need super smart machines. Theres really no use for them. What we need are droids like in star wars, that have a limited capacity for thought, and all their processing power goes to their jobs and their personality to befriend humans.\n\nC3P0 isnt concerned with enslaving humans because he only cares about serving luke and being a good protocol droid. A compliment is to a droid, what a treat is for a puppy.\n\nNot even battle droids are able to think that deeply.\n\nThis is due to mahines in the SWUniverse having a limited capacity for thought.\n\nObi wan clearly states that if droids have the ability to think, none of them would exist.\n\nThis is probably because at one point in their history AI became out of control, and wanted to kill everyone.\n\nThey probably enstilled rules after, that droids, would be concerned with friendship, their jobs, and their personality. Thats it. Nothing else is needed. We need comnpanions to avert loneliness, maybe lover bots to give people the ideal relationship, droids to help with our cars, and other tasks.\n\nAnd any machine that might be created to be fast or strong, needs to be made for a human avatar to pilot. Not a super machine that utilizes super strength and speed.\n\nA human being a screen would limit risk to human operatives, and police. While not endangering human beings with a robot that has the capacity for war and a malfunctioning AI operating system.\n\nWe dont need terminators. But robocop would make more sense. Without the macabre aspect of putting a dead human into a machine. but giving live humans the ability to sit on a VR rig, and control the machine.\n\nA machine with bionic mucle tissue and tons of enhancements, and when a human isnt piloting it, its shut down.\n\nJapan is already doing this with one of their little toy machines. The operator puts on a VR rig, a haptic suit and gloves, then goes on a imni directional tread mill to control the robot remotely.\n\nIt doesnt need an AI to operate its function. Humans do just fine. and with the neural chip coming,  we would be able to better integrate with the machine, maybe even without VR head gear.\n\n\nWe as a human race, DO NOT need AI to go very far.

In terms of knowledge, I was far ahead of his entire team which I had acquired by the dint of sheer hardwork throughout my career. Yet, he dropped my profile without even considering me for technical evaluation. Why? Ali Rodell is a descendant of white colonialists who impoverished the entire world . His white ancestors exploited my brown ancestors too. Thus, unlike him, I was not born previleged. I had to run my family and had no entitlement or previlege of attending premier universities whose alumni alone are worthy of consideration by the likes of Rodell. Consequently, only  those hailing from premier university pedigree will be considered for premier job roles by the likes of Ali Rodell. Thus, the discriminatory cycle continues.

This definition might be fine, if he weren\'t so overly broad with what he means by each word.\n\nMr. Stark can claim that it\'s the authoritative ""technical definition"" all he wants, yet he\'s missing that the _clustering_ and _semantic inference of that clustering_ of people according to their adjectives is the problematic piece of racism. \n\nIn the term ""racial prejudice"" it is the *prejudice* part of that phrase that is the problem -- not the ""racial"" part.\n\nHe says ""If you take the definition of racism as assigning some metric to an external feature and using it to make a judgment about the person..."" -- no.  We don\'t accept that as the definition of racism, because he then also moves the goalposts on what ""judgement"" means.  This is why he thinks that to quantify *anything* about a persons\' appearance for *any* purpose (even to unlock a phone) -- is racist.  If I\'m judging ""this person that I saw in this video frame is the same person that I saw in the previous video frame"" -- for him to claim that that\'s an example of a *necessarily racist* judgment is playing semantics that is bizarre to the point of stretching disbelief.  \n\nWhen he concludes by saying that to quantify someones\' liver or lungs via medical scan concerns him, and he wants to claim that the ""jury is still out"" on on *any* sort of numeric quantification on organ health measurement because it\'s probably racist also, then it\'s very difficult to take this guy seriously.\n\nIt really sounds like he\'s saying nobody should be allowed to record height or measure weight either (at least, not numerically) -- because that would be fundamentally racist, too.\n\nI came here hoping to hear an interesting discussion on the Facebook news, yet what I heard felt so disconnected from reality that it seems useful only for distracting attention from more productive approaches to the matter.  It feels like he\'s just another ivory-tower academic attempting to profiteer off of woke-washing academia and corporate marketing-speak... but ultimately offering nothing of value.\n\nAt some point, it feels like someone has to be willing to say, ""this makes no practical sense.""']"

Compare TWIML to two other offerings: Machine Learning Street Talk and Lex Fridman's podcast. Both are great and I really appreciate the content that they share, but they both have limitations for an audience that wants to get stuff done. Machine Learning Street Talk goes super-deep - incredible ambition and production values, but some of the topics are inaccessible to non-researchers. Lex Fridman gets incredible guests, and with the right guest he is unbeatable, but you need to be prepared for some philosophical digressions. By contrast, TWIML delivers practical insights from working guests week in and week out. We're lucky to have such a rich variety of content for a range of audiences.

You can use a fast transform as a set of fixed dot products and have adjustable parametric activation functions as a neural layer. That gives much higher speed and requires fewer parameters. The fast Walsh Hadamard Transform is a good choice. You do a simple random projection first to make good use of the first layer and a final transform as a pseudo-readout layer.\nRandom sign flipping will do for the fixed random projection, f(x)=ai.x x<0, f(x)=bi.x x>=0, i=0 to n-1 will do for the activation functions.']"

When one tries to provide examples to contradict the chutzpah, one gets shadow banned.\nIf one\'s only exposure is to deception, then when making choices, one\'s mental processes have already been skewed that one\'s decisions are very apt to take paths that shall harm themselves and their loved ones--as may have been the plan all along.\nSome super smart people have repeatedly said that it is the job of the listener to challenge obvious chutzpah by doing their own fact checking rather than accepting as factual any of the information that they are being told, i.e., it is your own fault that you were tricked into buying that as seen on TV miracle widget to clean your bathroom and kitchen, etc, when the thing actually doesn\'t work or breaks down soon after using it a couple of times--or similarly for mind virus ideologies that end up having the tricked become part of a backward cult that harms their friends and families.\nThe code and the hardware are by themselves benign, but when the training data is EXTREMELY biased, then the candidates for shadow banning become every average Jack and Jill who make up more than 50% of the population. \nIt is very disappointing that the ""Don\'t be evil motto"" was abandoned some while ago, when this should have stayed to better insure or constrain those in authority that a higher morality be maintained.\nFrom a very young age I could see that organized religions did not have the answer, however, some religions do have an underlying message of morality and ethics with a particular deity as their higher authority too keep followers on message or from straying away and doing harm. This force against doing harm is completely removed by secularism so that sociopaths and psychopaths can then make up their own guidelines that enable harm to be their main outcome, and that of their underlings or followers.\nAs an older person, I have seen this cultural, societal, educational landscape morph to allow these changes be brought in without any safeguards against run away immorality.\nThe any means necessary motto goes against the do unto others as you would have them do unto you--golden rule.\nOne quickly learns that feelings and emotions matter a lot less than your life being cut short by being tricked into believing lies--that physical violence is profoundly much worse that bad feelings and emotions when suddenly confronted with the truth that was hidden from you by overlords using ML Fairness AI to prevent the spread of common sense reality that could possibly counteract the ""desired"" Marxism.\nYouTube search stefan molyneux france burn till you learn\nWhen morality has been taken away, KBG spies refer to this as society being demoralized.\nWhen your culture has its key logic and reason removed, KGB spies refer to this as cultural subversion.\nYouTube search Logic, Fallacies, and the Trivium.

We now know at least 3 things about OpenAI: 1. This bot is most certainly not what it's cracked up to be, furthermore - it's no threat to mankind. 2. OpenAI is no longer open, demonstrating the more  general trend in the field. 3. The opinions of Social scientists now outweighs that of STEM experts, we invented the open source movement because we understand better than anyone the potency of technology and by extension that of corporations\\ governments using said technology - then social scientists come along and take on the role of what used to be the Church's. It's no longer 'safe' for us to do science and innovate, we don't 'understand' the implications, we're 'disruptive' and 'careless'. The day isn't long where adherence to their beliefs is mandatory.

Humans are incredibly creative and it is best to keep things as open as possible."", ""Nice conversation! At the beginning I was thinking of a publicity stunt... Normally I agree to be safe and follow the precautionary principle. That was not done with social networks and we're paying the cost of freeing the beast. At the same time, I know, as stated by Rob Munro, how easy someone can built an impressive bot just mixing sentences with a little random. GPT2 is another proof of the unreasonable effectiveness of data... I'm against not sharing the technology and the models. Doing that favors big companies at the expenses of small ones, researchers and minorities. Anyway, it's not possible to disinvent a technology. The solution should be regulatory and laws to control the abuses and the bad guys. That's the reason  why we have laws, police force to enforce it... and international treaties.

So assuming we predict that a team wins is 70 percent and the odd reward is less than 7/10 we are going to lose on average, even though our model was right.

And the lack of reasoning gets very visible on programming tasks. If you just skim over the code, it looks great. When you try to pay attention to the corner cases and check its logic, you\'ll often find flaws.\n\nOverall, ChatGPT is a nice bullshit generator.

The jobs of machine learning scientists will probably be safe for longer than the ones of your average Amazon employee, for example.\nWithout these huge leaps every second ai paper, I would feel much more motivated in life.

Outside of the Fall & the Spring, you may have to compete with experienced hires.\n\nFor internships, applying in the Fall is even more critical.

AI can already do this to some extent on its own. i suspect that conventional photogrammetry will disappear - it is tends to produce rather messy, unusable point clouds (or it least, it does for me!), whereas with AI i don't see why it won't be nice, clean geometry.\r\nmaybe professional 3D modelling will also disappear as a job? if generative AI can do it almost instantly, then market economics will take over. in that case, only amateurs and hobbyists will do 3D modelling. same goes for many, perhaps even the majority of, other non-manual jobs, now that AI can bootstrap itself and generate and fix its own code (as mentioned by me and others previously, this feels like we are close to the singularity, and much sooner than kurzweil predicted). \r\nwhen GPT4 gets incorporated into what one might call a `haptic` robot (haptic is not exactly the right word, but i hope it gives the right idea), that will be the beginning of the end of many manual jobs too - again, it will just be a matter of market economics. is it cheaper to employ a human or gaibot?

Of course it probably already can be done with existing technologies like google translate, but AI could give extra context for some idiomatic expressions or place names etc.\n\nor even more crazy in future, create ''video books'' where you do not just have audio for the book but also even if rudimentary, but visuals to give context of the scene and pretty much make any book into a crude animated movie... that would be fun.

Fantastic explanation.\n\nprogn in Emacs & Python\n\n\nRyan Hart\nExplain to me how `progn` works in Emacs by showing me the equivalent code in Python 3 using a practical example of using `progn` inside an `if` conditional inside of a function that returns a number.\n\n\n3 / 3\n\nprogn is an Emacs Lisp function that allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in sequence and returns the value of the last one. It is commonly used to group together a set of expressions that need to be executed together, particularly when multiple side effects are involved.\n\nIn Python, a similar effect can be achieved using a block statement, such as if, for, or while. These blocks can contain multiple statements that are executed in sequence, and the value of the last statement is returned by default. Therefore, we can simulate progn in Python by putting multiple statements inside a block statement.\n\nHere\'s an example of how this might look:\n\nphp\nCopy code\n(defun my-function (x)\n  (if (>= x 0)\n      (progn\n        (print ""x is non-negative"")\n        (+ x 1))\n    (progn\n      (print ""x is negative"")\n      (- x 1))))\nThis is an Emacs Lisp function that takes a number x as its argument and returns a new number based on whether x is positive or negative. If x is non-negative, the function prints a message to the console and returns x + 1. If x is negative, the function prints a different message and returns x - 1.\n\nTo convert this code to Python, we can use an if statement with multiple statements inside the block:\n\npython\nCopy code\ndef my_function(x):\n    if x >= 0:\n        print(""x is non-negative"")\n        return x + 1\n    else:\n        print(""x is negative"")\n        return x - 1\nIn this version of the code, we use the if statement to choose between two different sets of statements based on the value of x. The statements inside each block are executed in sequence, and the value of the last statement in each block is returned.\n\nSo, in essence, we\'ve replaced the progn function with an if statement and multiple statements inside the block. This achieves the same result as the original Emacs Lisp code.']"

Warp Stabilizer is nearly unchanged (except for better hardware performance) even to this day in 2022, it literally has not gotten any better in 11 years. Warp Stabilizer does have the ability to do edge synthesis which means that you don't have to crop the video, although it is incredibly hardware intensive and in many cases it's not worth the processing time, but it can be done if you are willing to wait. Smaller side note because I'm seeing this in the comments a lot: The jello look that comes from some forms of stabilization is actually caused from a cameras rolling shutter. Most cameras today except for a very small few cinema cameras use CMOS sensors which scan from bottom to top. Because they don't take a frame of video as an entire frame, when you skew those frames to stabilize them, you get the wonky jello effect. If you take footage from lets say, an ARRI Alexa that has a CCD sensor, you don't get the jello look when stabilizing."", 'When is this going to be implemented in consumer-focused software?', 'I got a smartphone gimbal recently and it works so well', '2:52 majimas hidin', 'This new method looks bad.

I will write what I wrote to the maker of that video:\n\nMe:\nI\'m curious to see if you can remove that opaque blob covering the guy on the left-side around 2:42-2:43. Recently we got that paper that detailed seeing behind objects such as that chain link fence to show the tiger (ie: in that 2 minute papers video from a couple weeks ago and the one the other day where the AI was filling in half the missing image). It would be sweet if you could generate the missing data about that guy on the left-side.\n\nDenis Shiryaev:\nI have tried, but pretrained models are generating just a mess, because they are not really understood the context of the image :(\n\nMe:\nThanks for your reply. That strikes me as a likely outcome given the size of the blob relative to the size of the image. The chain-link fence wires for example are quite minimal.\n\nBut that would be related to the task. If you can somehow get it to correctly identify the same object through multiple frames, you might be rapidly trending towards sweet progress.\n\nFor example if your video here is 288 frames or whatever you said, if you can label ""man on left"" in frame 200 to 210 or 200, 206, and 209, you might be able to copy/paste him into that position where he would be predicted to be in frame 201-205 (even if he is just predicted to be at the midpoint of where he is in frame 200 and 206). That would be better than nothing at all.\n\nAlso my apologies, I\'m just half speaking into the wind here :) If you can make any progress at all, perhaps you can collaborate with the maker(s) of that ""see around obstructions"" paper.\n\nAnd I am aware that using models compared to custom-manipulating the math is a bit of a heinous jump for anyone to make.\n\nMy main point is really just that this whole video you have here seems to be a beautiful use case to study that blob removal. If nothing else, spam it around as a muse for people :)', ""1:48 Yes I can see a little artifacting in the tiger's face, but the fence was already obscuring the tiger face originally.

I\'ve taken place in early developement testing where we played at least 10 games and never won any. \nAlthough calling it ""playing real Dota 2"" is a bit exaggeration as you mentioned the rules of openAI.\n\nFrom my experience, although how ""stupid"" they acted sometimes (buying back unneccessarily, committing big spells on support heroes, weird laning etc.) , the way they done teamfights were impressive. Seeing bots teleporting out in the middle of the fight with 100hp knowing the enemy doesn\'t have enough resources to cancel it, or deciding to chase you when you think you wouldn\'t be dead but the bots calculate if they slow you even 10% the other disable can reach you resulting a kill etc. They are merciless. \n\nI think the reason why they played such a dominating style of dota is the lack of decision making time. The bots don\'t say ""can we kill or do this?"" they be like, ""this is totally doable, lets do it."" and everyone follows that plan in that second. Not to mention knowing your strength and limits is important in Dota and even if you\'d repel them on one defense, they\'d just keep coming at you right after they respawn simply because they know they\'re ahead and should pressure you. \n\nWhen I was playing against OpenAI, it felt different than Dota 2 and that was really fun.

It decided to write a paper about why you may not be getting the sun protection you need:\n\n A group of scientists has found evidence that the effects of global warming are increasing the risk for people who use sunscreen to get the best protection from ultraviolet-b radiation. The scientists looked at the effect of UV rays on UV receptor sensitivity, and reported in the peer-reviewed science journal Nature that sunscreens protect against UV radiation only a bit better than they protect against a range of ultraviolet B radiation. ""UV rays are a significant contributor to skin cancer,"" said Dr John B urch of the Cancer Research UK Institute of Cancer Research. ""But if you use a sunscreen, you protect against a small part of the sun\'s harmful spectrum. The biggest cause of skin cancer is the sun itself."" The researchers used an ancient laboratory method which measured the amount of UV radiation emitted by exposed skin when exposed to different dosages of ultraviolet radiation, from ultraviolet A (UVA) to UVB (the highest damaging form of UVB radiation). They observed that the UV resistance of the skin was reduced with increasing the dose of sun screens applied at night. At the highest dose levels, 50% of the time, UV rays could only penetrate 30% of the human skin, exposing skin cancer, skin bleaching and photodam age. The study did not examine any of the effects of chemicals such as U VA rays which are harmful to sensitive skin but used very small doses in previous research carried out in the 1970s. Another key finding was that sunscreen reduces melanin production in the skin, but does not prevent it from darkening. ""UVA rays are less damaging to the skin than UVB rays because they are much less damaging to the eye,"" Dr B urch explained. The scientists are currently investigating whether sunscreen contains toxic chemicals known to cause harm to humans, as well as finding ways to reduce the risk to test people, as they have found that many Australians are not using sunscreen as recommended as their levels are high. ""There has been so much misinformation which is leading people to use high-dose products in the way they do. We want to take the opportunity to give them an education and to get them using the right amount of protection at the right time and to reduce their exposure to chemicals that are harmful,"" said Dr B urch . The results of the study have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. However, Dr Burch said it was important to remember that people are not \'in the sun \' but that their UV protection is a combination of factors. This includes getting to a latitude that doesn\'t cause sunburns , using an SPF of at least 30 at midday, being in the shade, being careful about sun exposure and wearing tight clothing during summer months. Sunscreens can be used in place of sunscreen, Dr Burch urged doctors. ""You should not stop using sunscreen, but if it is causing irritation, you should find another sun protection device. You should always use it as recommended ,"" he said. . . . The results of the study did not surprise Dr Burch \'s colleague Dr Peter Heiden. The University of Western Australia professor had been researching the effect of sun screens on skin health decades ago , and was shocked to find a link to skin cancer.. The study, The effects of sunscreen on human skin, found that ultraviolet radiation does have a serious effect on human skin, with it contributing to melanomas, and also contributing to other types of skin cancer and premature ageing... Skin cancer rates are increasing rapidly worldwide , and scientists have not yet understood exactly why. This does however mean that it is important to think hard about how to limit sun exposure , and to use a sun protection device. . .. The study also found that vitamin D levels at certain times during the solar cycle are a factor. This study is in line with the evidence that vitamin D helps to prevent skin cancer. . ..

Then it builds up to a higher level, so another part that is complex is understood even you never see it before, so playing the game first time take much less, than AI, but it is not equal much less since the AI process is the same process as a baby that grows up to understand how to play the game, so it is receiving and association what you receive as a representative so the external and internal which the internal processes to a higher level that is building up like 1, 2, 3, etc, 2 is not different from 1, yet it can be different than one since 2 add of two 1s, and add of two different of 1 which represents like paper and letter that interact so it can be written down.

The first match was a blast to watch due to the character of the pros playing against it and I'd recommend watching it for entertainment alone.\nIn the newest matches, the devs updated the ai to remove more of its limitations then it had when it played against the semi-pros as up to that point several major parts of the game were heavily restricted. During TI8 matches there were still several significant restrictions but they're slowly getting rid of them, looking forward to the developers overcoming the last ones. But what will really test them in the future is how fast the bots can learn the consequences of balance patches.\n\nHow the bots interact with and observe the game doesn't matter very much as the goal isn't to make a general ai that functions like a human but to make a program that can tackle a complex set of problems through reward and punishment over time. There's a bunch of articles online on the nuts and bolts of how they approached this, including how the bots 'see'.\n\nThe argument over terminology of moba/arts/wizard'em up/hero brawler/dota clone/a**fa**ots (yes that last one is a real acronym) is fundamentally flawed as the argument centers around the broken way video games are classified by mechanics rather than genre. For a quick and dirty example of how this convention fails; both Goat Simulator and Max Payne are Third-Person Shooters. Best to use the most widely used term so people know what you're talking about rather than attempt to fix a broken pedantry.\n\nIn most RTS games there's a correct or optimal action to take at any time. What that action is varies but both players know what the other player can do at any point because of the time it takes to gather resources and build bases/units. As the game goes on what each player can optimally do shrinks as the opponent's strategy to win becomes more apparent and the path to counter it with their own plan becomes clear. This isn't a perfect description as most good games have a wide possibility space but without changes the games become solved, coin flips, or games of optimization/inches.

I can‚Äôt find the command or way to do this, so this is probably just be a lack of my understanding, or possibly its something about the software.  This state saving requirement breaks down into four use cases:\n1. If I am doing a long training run it would be useful to be able to take checkpoints at intervals, say after an hour.  These checkpoints could then be used to restart a run from that point without having to restart from the beginning.  The goal is largely to make the learning process more robust (and hence faster and cheaper).  Tensorflow, in comparison, has the ability to write all or a subset of variables to file as a checkpoint.  Does dm_control have some such capability? \n2. The second use case is that after learning it would be very useful to be able to save the state of the learning so that it can be used operationally.  State here includes the neural network node values within the policy networks, plus all other variables needed to reproduce results.  It would appear that the videos that DeepMind provides of the humanoid running past obstacles have probably been created in this way on saving a checkpoint after each stage of the curriculum (although maybe they used another approach).  How should I do this?\n3. The third use case relates to the essence of the paper, in being able to take a partially trained agent, trained on one terrain (or environment), and then give it a different environment to train it further.  In the dm_control XML files for the various bodies the <geom \\> tag is used to define the basic terrain, however I can‚Äôt see how richer terrains are generated and applied.  What is the best way to do this?\n4. A fourth use case not directly described in the papers would be to apply learning from one body to another body.  It would be interesting to use say the planar walker (which just has legs and no arms) as the initial learning vehicle and then apply that learning to a body with arms (such as the humanoid). \nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated."", 'Wouldn\'t it be wise to include ""energy efficiency"" as a secondary optimization parameter (additional to distance).

It is very time consuming to take photographs from a drivers perspective in real life and then have artists look at the images. The artists have to trace the silhouettes of objects such as cars, pedestrians, and more, and then label them. However, with a video game one can quickly generate a screen capture of a scene from the perspective from someone driving. The software can also generate an image from the same perspective, but where the cars and various other objects are all automatically outlined an labeled; no human artist has to laboriously trace the outlines. This summary of the previous two minute video was longer than I wanted it to be, but my point is that I think you could do something similar for creating training sets from modeling furniture arrangements in a room. For training images, instead of taking photographs of furniture layouts in real life, one could instead use screen captures of furniture in a room from video-games. To get training examples, there is no need to  have an artist laboriously create a 3d model from the 2D image of furniture in a room. In a video-game, the computer already has the correct 3D model. You could create huge training sets of flat pictures of furniture in a room with the corresponding correct 3D model for that image. Hopefully the computer modeled furniture from the video-games would be realistic looking enough that when you fed the AI photographs of real-world scenes, the software would still be able to correctly output reasonably good 3d models to describe the scene.', 'I wonder what would happen if you feed the image it generated to itself.

Crash Course, SciShow, CGPGrey, Kurzgesagt.... many many more (and I\'m sure you know them all) already do a great job dealing with these things in maybe subtly different ways.\nHaving hand crafted info boxes at the bottom of the screen (or wherever is appropriate) on top of that isn\'t bad either.\n\nAlso, I wouldn\'t mind you employing a system similar to what CGPGrey and Brady Haran do every so often: Grey often uses ""Footnotes"" in his videos which are just small indicators in a corner of the video that link to further, more detailed information in a shorter hidden video. This feature relies on annotations which aren\'t mobile friendly but you can augment it with the (i) box and the descriptions.\nBrady _also_ does something like that but in his case these are generally linked at the end of the video, they are often longer than the original video, and they provide more details or less-cut versions of interviews. Also, after a while he tends to actually unhide his secret videos, giving ""hardcore fans"" who are ""in the know"" a chance to be early while newer watchers still find out about them later on, all the while avoiding to swamp video subscription boxes with the gazillions of videos he tended to upload in his fastest of times. (Since he moved away from Nottingham, his output has slowed, but it\'s still great)\n\nI think Brady\'s approach is very much tailored to his high output and almost all of his videos are meant to be watchable on their own, whereas Grey\'s is more about deep-dives on smaller details which don\'t make much sense without having seen ""the main"" video. Both approaches are great; indirectly they also are a bit of a game ""are you insider enough to having found _this_ little thing? :D :D :D"" which adds to it, and I suspect the ideal approach for you would sit roughly in between the two.\nIf you have the time and budget for it, I\'d love to see a bit more detailed videos. But if you don\'t want to clutter your main videos with all that detail, fearing to make people shy away, then a footnote style approach would be great to have the best of both worlds :)\n\nAnyway, I really like that this channel now is at the point of having this very problem.

The output algorithm\'s ""code"" is the concrete assignment of neural connection weights. This is why we do not understand how neural networks actually work: we only understand how to evolve them.\n\nThis brings deep learning into a similar ballpark as evolution. Evolutionary algorithms and deep learning appear to do similar things with the important distinction that evolutionary algorithms require explicit sampling during training, whereas deep learning has a more efficient, gradient-driven method of identifying the direction where the optimal algorithm might lie.\n\nConsidering this prompts me to assign a great scientific importance to the understanding of these kinds of meta-algorithms: it might have taken 3 billion years, but produced humans after all, so the potential of these methods is already proven by natural processes (which might not be replicable in the human world due to computational limitations, but at least we have a promising direction for now).', 'It doesn\'t has much to do with the main subject of this video, but you talk briefly about languages and rules.

Then you mark the product of the areas for all possible positions of the copy strip.\n\nIt\'s conceptually easier to do this with something finite: Draw a small function that\'s zero everywhere except on a small interval in which it is finite on a piece of paper (even better: transparent foil). Then take the strip of paper and fold it onto itself, starting from the edge. (Don\'t press the fold shut or else it\'ll be hard to shift the edge)\nFor every position of the fold, note how much the function overlaps with itself.

The first thing is relatively pain-free and ""sexy"", while the second thing is Hard Work, and mostly considered unglamorous, painstaking and slow.

Basically, any real-life implementation of an advanced algorithm empowers some, while it disempowers others. At the same time, the vast majority of people will get stupider and maybe more hateful; people get *less civilized*, as they loose all incentive to learn. We already see this in our universities.\nThat\'s my own personal projection. The outcome could be different, no doubt about it. But it won\'t, i guess.\nThe outcome, ultimately, of the revolution that we are going through right now is that humans will reinvent themselves -- like they did so many times before. But how many people will get left behind?\nPeople can reinvent themselves in about a generation, that is: 20-30 years. And we can get even more adaptable than that. But the things that carry our values are the larger organizations. And the larger, the more complex an organization is, the more slowly it changes. And even if faster change *was* possible, rapid, untried changes will *always* result in the overall degradation of a system. This is inevitable in the short term, since introducing a change to a system is always easier than dealing with all the wreckage that it causes. Like, the introduction of the internet, web search, etc. caused a massive ""screen addiction"" to our generation, be it porn or otherwise.\nMy point is, basically, that the less constants we have, the more vulnerable we are, who- or whatever we are to become. The introduction of a new feature pushes out something old: and it pushes out the values attached to that old thing, thereby leaving a ""hole"" in us. This has been known forever: the same thing happened in the story of Adam and Eve: they ate the fruit of knowledge, and it left them in a world where \'something\' essential is missing. The only way to not see this is to be excited all the time. But change is also inevitable, so i\'m not blaming change for anything. This is a call to discover the shape and size of that hole, together with the content that got lost. The lost content cannot be restored to a changed system, but it can be reintroduced in a new way. This has been known forever as well: that\'s why Adam and Eve were immediately promised, that there was going to be a second Adam, who will mend completely the damage that was done. Crucially, this promise concerns every \'fruit of knowledge\', present, past and future. Who knew? Seriously, who was the person to know about this kind of problem? And what what are we to do about him?\n\nI digress. A concrete situation demands a concrete solution. the lost content either needs to be reintroduced in a new way, or be replaced with something of an equal value. If this is not done, we as humans will get more and more vulnerable, and degraded, until we degrade down to a point of no return. \n(p.s. for many humans, this is how this is how their future is described near the end of the bible, so this is a serious warning)']"

It doesn\'t always work (in fact, most experiments thus far, I think, have shown that some kind of mix between this ""exploratory"" goal and a ""fitness""-type goal work best) but it has been successfully applied in particular in cases where the perfect case (here: running infinitely far without ever stumbling) isn\'t reachable.

Such output would mostly just end up with a dog flailing around at the start and thus wouldn\'t seem very different.

But if you, say, take one of your goals to be ""end up in different locations"", which was one of the first novelty search concepts to be tried, you\'ll quickly exhaust the points near the starting location and you\'ll automatically be pushed forward to greater and greater distances to still find more unique points.

After any further iteration, you'll have less and less and at some point, you'll definitely get zero as there simply won't be any more energy to reflect and so, bounce. It is like a lim where radiosity tends to zero, isn't that right? If it was possible to be infinite, then there would be times when in the real world we would be able to conduct such an experiment: in the absolutely dark room, turn on your flashlight and immediately turn it off. After turning it off you should still be able to catch photons/energy rise in materials where the light has bounced off for an indefinite period of time. But this is not the case (or our technologies do not allow to conduct such an experiment so that to confirm or deny the fact).\n\nI think, for the game industry, there can be some desirable limit set for bounces as the amount of energy can always be precalculated (as the game developers know what is possible in their game world and what's not, or at least unlikely) and so they may be able to limit the number of bounces to calculate like to 10, as after 10 there won't be any perceivable (or even visible) change of image."", ""Hello there, I am a bit confused, but I might be wrong.

c7e-D2tmRE0,"['k-way spectral clustering is related to SVD. In fact, SVD can be used to solve the k-way spectral clustering problem.\n\nSVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ into three matrices:\n\n```\n$\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{V}^T$\n```\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{U}$ and $\\mathbf{V}$ are orthogonal matrices and $\\mathbf{S}$ is a diagonal matrix of singular values.\n\nIn k-way spectral clustering, we are given a graph with an adjacency matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. We want to partition the graph into $k$ clusters such that the edges between clusters are minimized.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L}_n = \\mathbf{D}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{D}^{-1/2}$, where $\\mathbf{D}$ is the diagonal matrix of degrees of the graph nodes.\n\nThe eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{L}_n$ can be obtained using SVD. Once we have the eigenvectors, we can use them to project the graph nodes into a lower-dimensional space. In this lower-dimensional space, the clusters are more likely to be well-separated.\n\nThen, we can use a clustering algorithm such as k-means to cluster the projected graph nodes. This will give us a k-way clustering of the original graph.\n\nSo, how is k-way spectral clustering related to SVD? SVD is used to compute the eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian matrix, which are then used to project the graph nodes into a lower-dimensional space where the clusters are more likely to be well-separated.\n\nHere is a pseudocode for k-way spectral clustering using SVD:\n\n\n1. Compute the normalized Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L}_n$.\n2. Compute the SVD of $\\mathbf{L}_n$: $\\mathbf{L}_n = \\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{V}^T$.\n3. Project the graph nodes into a lower-dimensional space using the first $k$ eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{U}$.\n4. Cluster the projected graph nodes using k-means.\n5. Return the resulting k-way clustering.\n\n\nIt is important to note that there are other ways to solve the k-way spectral clustering problem, such as using the normalized cut objective function.

However, they also have distinct focuses and areas of expertise. Let's explore the differences and overlaps between these two roles:\n\nCloud Engineer:\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nInfrastructure Management: Cloud Engineers primarily focus on designing, implementing, and managing cloud infrastructure. This includes setting up servers, storage, networks, and other cloud resources.\n\nCloud Platform Expertise: They specialize in a specific cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud and are responsible for optimizing its usage and cost-efficiency.\n\nScalability: Cloud Engineers ensure that the infrastructure can scale up or down to meet the demands of applications and services.\n\nSecurity: They implement security measures to protect cloud resources, including access controls, encryption, and compliance.\n\nResource Provisioning: Cloud Engineers provision resources on-demand, automate deployments, and ensure high availability.\n\nMonitoring and Optimization: They monitor cloud resources for performance, cost, and reliability and make necessary adjustments.\n\nDevOps Engineer:\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): DevOps Engineers focus on automating the software development and deployment pipeline. They design and implement CI/CD processes to enable rapid and reliable software releases.\n\nAutomation: DevOps Engineers automate repetitive tasks, including code builds, testing, and deployment, using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or AWS CodePipeline.\n\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC): They use IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define and provision infrastructure as code, ensuring consistency and version control.\n\nCollaboration: DevOps promotes collaboration between development and operations teams. DevOps Engineers facilitate communication and teamwork to achieve a seamless development-to-production workflow.\n\nMonitoring and Troubleshooting: They implement monitoring and logging solutions to detect issues early and troubleshoot them efficiently.\n\nContainerization and Orchestration: DevOps Engineers work with containers (e.g., Docker) and container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to enhance application portability and scalability.\n\nOverlaps and Common Tasks:\n\nAutomation: Both Cloud Engineers and DevOps Engineers heavily rely on automation to streamline processes, whether it's infrastructure provisioning or code deployment.\n\nMonitoring: Monitoring is crucial for both roles. Cloud Engineers monitor cloud resources, while DevOps Engineers monitor applications and the entire deployment pipeline.\n\nSecurity: While Cloud Engineers focus on securing cloud infrastructure, DevOps Engineers also address security by integrating security checks and scans into the CI/CD pipeline.\n\nKey Differences:\n\nFocus: Cloud Engineers primarily focus on cloud infrastructure and its management, while DevOps Engineers concentrate on the end-to-end software development and deployment process.\n\nExpertise: Cloud Engineers are experts in a specific cloud platform, while DevOps Engineers have a broader skill set that encompasses development, automation, and operations.\n\nScope: Cloud Engineers deal with infrastructure provisioning and management, whereas DevOps Engineers work on the entire software development lifecycle, from code commits to production deployment.\n\nIn summary, while Cloud Engineers and DevOps Engineers have overlapping responsibilities related to automation and monitoring, their primary areas of expertise and focus differ. Cloud Engineers specialize in cloud infrastructure management, while DevOps Engineers specialize in optimizing software development and delivery processes.\n\nHere is your website link:\nhttps://gildwaretechnologies.com/courses-details/software-engineering-job-oriented-program\n\nYou can click on the link above to access the specified webpage.

On the best practice n.6 ""Secure Secret Data"" I do have a few concerns and I hope you could clarify them.\nIf secrets are used to pass env variables to the pod\'s container (their actual supposed use) then an attacker could just run a simple kubectl -exec -it <podname> -- env which will show them all. Now as you said, you can either (1) encrypt your Secrets with encryption at rest,  or (2) manage them with Vault. In the encryption at rest scenario (1) , Secrets will be decrypted when requested and then inject their values into pod\'s container, so the attacker could still use the command above and get them. Using a secure store (2) as Vault instead ( which by the way requires you to extensively configure it manually,  unseal it, create the secrets an so forth, even with auto-unseal ), with either it\'s own operator or  a secret manager tool like Sealed Secret or External Secrets will in the end create an unencrypted Secret to be used, which will lay around in the cluster and we\'re back at square one with the secret problem. Plus also in the scenario (2)  the attacker could still use the command above to get all the env variables. There is another possible scenario (3) in which no secrets management is ( apparently ) involved, which is use a secure store inside your app directly like Azure Key Vault so no secret are involved for your sensitive data. WRONG! Also in this scenario (3) you have to deal with sensitive data, you access details to the Secure store. You just trade a set of sensitive data for another set. So even in the scenario you\'re  back at square one as you now need to secure Azure\'s credentials Service Principals\' and Vault\'s names, ids and secrets. The only thing that changed is that you\'re spending more as getting the secrets from the secure store is not free, and with the command above now the attacker has you azure account details.\nNana can you please expand on this point?\nI\'m going in circles on this quite frustrating subject. It\'s not even a chicken and egg problem, it is just adding layers of ( what it feels like) useless complications which won\'t stop any attacker at all who\'s been able to get access to the cluster so skilled enough to get to the sensitive data in scenario 3.

If feedback is allowed: I only disagree majorly on Part3, Calling Alpine ""security-oriented"" is not true and a well proven fact, that Alpine images report 0 CVE and such, because Alpine only pulished CVEs after they fixed it, other images like Debian and Ubuntu might be bigger, but at least they are honest and dont lie about IT-Security regarding their images ... This is especially hard for people who are working with Ruby on Rails, so often the DEVS in a company have to track all CVEs and remind Alpine to finally fix them. You might have 10 CVEs in a Debain or Ubuntu images as an example but at least they are honest, you know of it you can try to fix it and you know what you get yourself into .... While on Alpine with this shady shadow it approach you never now on what and how many exploding or already exploded bombs you are sitting because they just are not transparent about stuff like that. Thats why Alpine is considered Bad-Practice for production.

But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

You\'re helping a lot of us learn about LLMs and connectors like LangChain.\n\nSome things I wish you could expand on in your videos (I realize all of these require more work, but I think would be a huge help!)\n1. The writing/chalk board style is helpful, but takes time to write out and doesn\'t always seem like you get the results you want. I think using a simple PowerPoint/Slides to build a base for your instruction would be more helpful. I like how ""Data Independent"" does it. He uses basic slides which are quick to make but is better than scribbling. You can lay out document text, API screenshots, real-life examples better than being able to draw with Wacom. It\'s night and day better for helping people visualize. Then if you can use the Wacom tablet to draw on top of it, great. But slides help layout the information you want to talk about a head of time instead of writing on the fly. \n2. The workbooks are incredible, it would be awesome if you could link to the API documentation when you\'re using it. E.g. you know that ""stuff"" or ""map_reduce"" are available for RetrievalQA.from_chain_type.chain_type.....why? Where are you looking? It\'s the old ""teach a man to fish"" analogy. Instead of people just copying what you\'re doing, they would be able to better change things or adapt to their own situation.\n3. I know you covered it in your other videos, but would have been great to talk about token limits in this Agent use case. Talking about putting in the prompt, the chat history, the retrieved documents from the vector DB, the query, and the answer all have to fit in your LLM token limit (I think). This is crucial info. It also affects the ConversationBufferWindowMemory ""k=5"".\n4. It would be helpful to talk about why Agent is even needed in this case. It looks like in your example it either does 1) ""I don\'t know"" or 2) use the Lex Fridman DB. Essentially that means it uses Lex Fridman DB every time, which doesn\'t help show why an Agent is needed. I know you only have so much time in a video to explain things but that\'s kind of crucial when setting up an Agent to decide across many different services.\n\nThank you again.']"

It's an art. In a nutshell. Experiment with microphones, they vary greatly. One in fifty are good enough to have a full range from 20 Cycles to 18,000 Cycles and it needs to produce this on its own as straight out flat, no graphic equalizer. Hold the microphone 1/2 inch below your chin and 1/2 inch towards your throat, positioning the microphone under your lower jaw. Next aline and direct the microphone towards your throat. This will produce and incredible up close and personal affect. Because the vocal cords in your throat is where the bass is produced, the sound from your mouth is where the highs are produced, but these alone produce an undesirable voice recording, the throat is what is needed to equalize the desired effect. Following this procedure is vital. I realize this would be difficult for a video if you are in the image. But the sound of your voice will Captivate your audience when making recordings when you're not in the image. Some people use a clip-on microphone attached to their shirt. This is a complete failure. If you experiment, you may find your audience doesn't mind you holding the microphone in one hand under the chin as described above. But it's killer audio, for your audience. Advice that took me years to master. Special note, when looking for a microphone, go to a guitar store where they sell the professional equipment, and make them plug several microphones that you are considering into a amp, to test performance on each. I can tell you microphones that cost over $1,000.00 are usually junk. Also, I prefer that dynamic microphone made with coils and magnets like they made in the 1970s over microphones that are made with a computer chip. Good luck if you want to sound fabulous."", 'Impressive, can it be used for face recognition or for non face images only?', 'super cool!', 'Awesome !']"

Hence, it is called ""product"" quantization. I didn\'t get that part (why product quantization when we are summing the distances?). Thanks for the awesome video!\n\nDoubt 2:\nAt 28:10 the q(u) is the dense vector of the closest centroid that u is mapped to? Then we are just calculating the euclidean distance between the dense query xq with a dense vector q(u) for every single u in the dataset. How is that faster than just calculating the euclidean distance between the query xq with each dense vector (not PQ) in the dataset?\n\n[edit] I think the answer to doubt 2 is precomputation. \nIf nbits is 8, we only have 256 distinct centroid values. And each subvector in our query xq, only has 2^nbits/m centroids associated with it. So we precompute the distance between each subvector (0 --> m) in xq and the corresponding centroids (0 --> nbits/m for each subspace).\n\nFor each dense vector xb_i in xb, we only store the code value, e.g. if D = 128 and we PQ it with m = 8 (subspaces), nbits = 8 (2^nbits centroids). Each subspace has 2^nbits/m centroids = 2^8/8 = 32.\n\nWe only store PQ(xb_i) = [0, 17, 31, 2, 5, 6, 1, 28] (random e.g. of a vector in the dataset to be searched against) AND the codebook for reproducing the dense centroid of each subspace.\n\nRough algorithm:\n0. Find centroids (total 2^nbits/m) in each subspace (m) for the vectors in xb (for all xb_i in xb). \n1. Precompute the distance between subspaces of query xq with centroids in each subspace and store in hash-table for fast lookup.\n2. Iterate over all PQ(xb_i)\n   3. using codebook, reproduce the dense centroid vector for value in PQ(xb_i)\n   4. Calculate the approximate distance between query xq and PQ(xb_i) by summing up the euc. distances of each subspace. (lookup takes O(1) time, we do m lookups, 1 for each subspace, and then m additions). The time complexity of approx. distance for a query against a single PQ(xb_i) is O(m).\n   5. Store the xb_i with the minimum approximate distance to xq.', ""This is such an amazing explanation of product quantization!

Because this course shows you which can be the outcomes with the data. I caught myself in previous courses and final projects not knowing exactly where I was going. I had a lot of charts and insights from the data, but I had no clue about what is important, how much is enough, how to build a decent presentation. And in this Tableau course they teach you like you are a child, they really make things easy to understand. \n\nOn top of that, I finally understood how pivot tables in excel work. So I cannot recommend that enough. \n\nNow I can go in deep with R, Python, even increase my skills in SQL and I have a much better idea in what to look for in the data, how I can present it, what would be the best for my audience, etc.\n\nThe SQL course I did learn about SQL and it's very good indeed, although the second module is challenging and requires a bigger effort and patience.

However, I only require a specific attribute, so I tried generating a list on the output point. Unfortunately, it seems that although the join is performed, nothing is displayed in the table.\r\n\r\nCould you please guide me on how to retain only the desired attribute and ensure it is visible in the table?', 'Hello.
