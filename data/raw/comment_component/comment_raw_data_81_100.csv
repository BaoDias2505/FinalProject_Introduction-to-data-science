I mean how can we make the whole setup free of cost(no money paid) on own local computer?', 'thanks, please, tutorial more advanced! ;) thanks!', ""»⟩ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

If you watch it for about an hour, you will notice that the closed captioning has many errors in it, that are obvious if you listen to the video, but would be difficult to spot if they were transcribed and then subsequently summarized. In essence, summaries done by AI, are ok for a quick overview, but should not be used for deep understanding simply because they do get a lot wrong.\n   Another issue is that by skipping the video, you actually miss out on a lot of information that you would not necessarily get from the video itself... (A picture is worth a 1000 words). This is why audio books, while good, cannot compete with video books in general when trying to describe visual content.']"

I am committed to the Open Source Society University (OSSU) which offers both curriculums following the ACM/IEEE curriculum recommendations for undergraduate degree programs in CS and DS. My problem is, that they don't have a specific curriculum for a specialization on AI and machine learning. This is why I'm thankful for your tips in regard to this field and I appreciate your videos to help me finding the best supplemental materials for my planning.

tb7UFCKM-J4,"[""I'm working with my agency who have hired AI developers and I feel like they learning everything I do to upload my consciousness to the cloud to have AI be able to do what I do.  I have no idea whether this will be true or not but it absolutely feels like Paul Bunyon vs the Chain Saw.  AI is coming whether I want it or not so I'm personally better served in the long run if I accept it and work with the AI developers instead of against them even though it feels like I'm helping to sharpen the blade that's gonna cut me.  I don't mean to be alarmist, but I do think that AI has the potential to change the way DA's do business, just not sure how yet.\n\nNow, on the other hand, I'm reminded of an episode of The Office where Michael and Dwight use GPS to go to a sales call and the GPS drives them into a lake.  I still think that AI needs SME's to drive it, train it, and audit it to ensure it provides good, true, and useful results.  I think that that is where DA's can somewhat expect to go.  But I really don't know as only time will tell.  Video killed the radio star; the automobile put out of business the horse & carriage industry; digital music killed cd's which killed cassettes, which killed records.  I'm sure the list can go on and on about how one innovation replaced another and we're better off en masse for it but it still comes at the cost of change.  Either change or get left behind, is how I see it."", ""Love the video, but I have some thoughts. Mind you, this is partially copy-paste from a comment on another youtube video I responded too, but her video was way more unrealistic, as it was based on 2 fallacies in her rationale:\n\nThe Main Fallacies in Logic people make when considering if Analysts are replaced: Exponential increase of capabilities of Ai, as is your assumption that Critical Thinking and 'Creativity' are a safehaven for replacement by Ai. This is a kind of 'human exceptionalism' thinking, the idea that Human intelligence has properties that an Ai could never copy.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\nThis is the fallacy in reasoning that almost everyone who doesn't think this is actually happening is falling into. Both Creative and Repetive Analysts will be replaced. The idea that because they need 'critical thinking' is making her impervious to replacement is a big, big, big mistake. \r\n\r\nTransformer LLM's are specialized at pattern finding, and they are much better at it than any human, and the pattern finding is the foundation for what you consider 'creativity' because it's that 'creativity' that allows  an analyst to find patterns that weren't identified before, which is what makes her good at her job. \r\n\r\nThus she will be replaced, because what you think is 'creativity' or 'critical thinking' is actually foundational feature of current generativeAi models, and it scales perfectly with Dataset and computational resources, so it's not a matter of IF but a matter of WHEN.\n\nYou assumed at the start that AGI would be game over, but that's not true, there's a big, big category below AGI that still would mean Analysts have no reason for existing (not human ones anyway) an AGI would be a consciousness that can do anything a human can, like ride a bicycle, or a car, or eat an icecream (if it had a stomach) etc. \n\nNone of that is required for the perfect Analyst. An A.I. can be created, that is not conscious, but has enough semantic capabilities, that it can perfectly simulate a Human analyst in how it responds and interacts, it has enough creativity (basically brute force computational power) to find novel ways of interpreting data (which is basically just pattern finding) that it can easily out perform a human's ability for critical thinking and creativity. \r\n\r\nAi has gone from scoring 26% on Medical Licensing Exam in early 2022 to score 86% in February 2023..  That is nearly 4X increase in performance within 1 year. \r\nHuman doctors only score a 94% at best, but Ai will score 100% a 100% of the time within a year. \r\n\r\nPeople need toStop thinking they're special because they're a sack of meat and water... Ai will replace you. \r\n\r\nIt's not a bad thing. We will have UBI and everyone will be free to pursue their passion, but first economies will collapse."", '""How would it feel if your phone disappeared forever?""\nI imagine something like the freedom and peace a heroin addict would feel if he was spontaneously sober and not addicted.', ""Well, unless AGI can run an entire business or government operation all by itself without human intervention, I don't see this negative scenario. I see AI as a tool to boost human productivity. Imagine a data analyst who can increase their output by a factor of three or more. Same with other occupations like accountants, copy writers or graphic designers.\n\nIn addition, if billions of people don't have a job or career, how can they purchase the products or services made by all these companies? Sounds like a race to the bottom to me. Greed always winds up shooting itself in the foot.\n\nThere may be a need to really consider Universal Basic Income to act as a safety net in case automation does in fact replace millions of jobs, and people can still keep a roof over their head, clothes on their back, and food on the table."", ""I have a question\nAI will not replace data analyst completely but\n\nBut i don't find a need to have data analyst in organisations because\nAfter the advent of AI data scientist, data managers  can also do this work.\n\nOr some organisations may  have data analyst but just for some senior level positions only \n\nThere is no need to have Freshers for data analyst any more"", 'super tutor on the computer', ""Hello, Lukas.

Basically, google had the best and most coherant course which gave me confidence to take a university degree in data analysis since college degree is required in my country. However, the next course IBM data science which im in course number 9 (data visualisation), is very dense and a lot to understand which kind of not beginner friendly tbh. I felt like I should've taken python for everybody before taking the IBM course since it is python focused. My point is I don't feel as confident that I learnt much from IBM because it is too much and too complex of a course. First thing is it's not as good as google method of teaching and their videos doesn't explain much because in documentation there are a lot of things that doesn't exist in videos. Also, this course is extremely boring due to lack of human interaction and the bugs are extremely frustrating especially the IBM cloud and DB2. \n\nIn conclusion, if u don't have a strong coding foundation, the IBM course will be challenging and u better take python dedicated courses first and also focus on data analysis part even more. My goal was to finish the IBM data science and take IBM data engineering but i realised if i do that i might finish the course but i wont learn or grasp the information very will. I will finish IBM data science soon but the confidence level and information quality and understanding is not as google course or i can say i learned less due to complexity and I wasnt ready enough for the course."", 'Lots of very helpful infos.. u r the best sir thank you']"

opium? pot? anything that could be harmful, people should be able to grow it only for self consumption, not used as a business too profit from, where evolves gangs, murders for business. cigarettes are stated it may be harmful, so not sold as a business for profit. how many people would grow their own tobacco? it takes 3 months too grow, its an ugly plant, and takes a month too dry, how many would still smoke tobacco? how many would have quit. why make everyone else suffer for them? where its legal how many people still buying marijuana, pay debt/tax, when they can grow it for free. why make/buy pharmaceutical drugs when they can grow it naturally for free. people think, do anything for em-ploy(a cunning plan or action designed to turn a situation to one's own advantage(profit?)? the war on drugs. for the financial system of employment of by-law officers, police, drug squad, courts, lawyers, jails, probation department etc... for safety and security or debt? some police chiefs admitted they liked the drugs sold on the dark web, it removed the business of gangs and their murders. also people learn from example not force. how many people are put in jail for drugs, get out and use drugs again? a religious cult started the jail system, after stated it does more harm then help people, yet its now just a business for profit. all can be an exceptional mother, father that use naturally self grown coffee, opium, cocaine, pot, alcohol etc... not have to prostitute, commit crimes, murders, for the high prices and jail time attached legally. allot of people legally act as a commodity in the pharmaceutical legal drug cult business for years, decades, almost all getting very negative side effects, then get more drugs for the side effects, even committing suicide, legally? also the debters(anything using debt illusion) put a debt on something, make it illegal, then own the monopoly(moneypoly) of it. then have the legal persons, police, army, c.i.a etc... anything not complying to pay, they charge, imprison, cause wars and murders to protect their debt illusion on something. legally force people to pay tax/debt illusion, to pay their legal system's personnel to serve and protect their monopolies. about 75% of all criminal activities evolve from debters monopolies, 100 % from debt illusion. the 3 most important things a child needs to know? how to create food for medicine from plants(let food be your medicine and medicine be your food, yet even food is used as a commodity for slavery), how to create a shelter that has  water and hydro for free, how to be free from debt illusion, to forgive, especially themselves, able too love themselves and others. yet none are taught in the education system. there was a child that had turrets, her parents gave her nicotine and the turrets vanished. all man, woman and children are different, what may help one may harm another. all men, woman and children must be free to know themselves too love and enjoy anything. love creates. \nimagine, think a body and spirit, is love, wise, and power, able to forgive and be free?\navoid debt, the lie, be true and free."", ""where does all slavery, corruption, pollution, suffering, wars and murders evolve from?\n\ncould it be so simple? that anything that has a debt attached is corrupted? does a fruit tree ask for a debt, to get paid, or else? does a tomato? a strawberry? maybe water? a naturally created home? could it be that people only need too avoid and protect themselves from debt illusion? too be free, happy and healthy?\n\nwhat is? evil? the d-evil? demons? hell? the enemy? cult? the veil? the lie? the liar? evolve from? its DEBT!!!\n\nwhen debt is forgiven, none must make something suffer too force them to pay a debt.\n\nhere's something strange, try to show anyone debt, what colour is it? what shape? what does it smell like? its not real, an illusion, its the lie. \npeople can love themselves and others, have peace and share it etc... none can put themselves in debt to themselves and pay it(non can incriminate themselves), can only do it to others, its the hypocrite(narcissists/sociopaths/psychopaths, actors), all a parasite, it can only take, never love, forgive and share.\n\nfriends forgive each others debt illusion,  enemies do not. forgive all debt illusion, forget all enemies, forget all wars, there is peace.\n\nonly by knowing the enemy can any man, woman and child protect themselves, family, friends and nature by forgiving, especially themselves.\n\nis it best for any child, anyone too know?

what color is it? what shape? how does it smell? its not real, a presumption, the lie). they evolved the birth certificate(a legal trust, stealing every child\'s free equal share of the land and resources), its a corporation, signed by debters(anything using debt illusion). the corporate registrar general, then given to the people, evolved into the debters  artificial corporate society, with its artificial em-ploy-ees/slaves. the police departments, fire departments, healthcare departments, tax departments etc... are all corporations, what owns the corporations and employees? corporations only have jurisdictional authority with other corporations, never its law, its creator. the corporate banks could legally use debt illusion(where all corruption, slavery, pollution, suffering, wars and murders evolve from) with the peoples birth certificate. legally trying too buy/own all land, water, nature and what people create. attach their debt illusion(no god). in its corporate jail, where they make their own codes, statutes, rules that other corporations and employees must legally honour its corporate legal political communist system, that is all debt illusion. in their corporate court, hatred and wars are legal, profitable, illegal to love and forgive, unprofitable. did any artificial persons ask to volunteer in ignorance(entrapment) to corporate codes and statutes, to contracts? best not to agree, consent to any corporate presumption, lies. best to being free to create and share anything knowing the law and god.\nimagine, think a body, mind and soul, is love, wise, and power, able to forgive and be free?\navoid debt, the lie, be true and free.\n\ncourt; lawyers or jury of people; men, woman, children and nature.\nthe court was created by the people, for the people, with a jury of people. anyone thinking another owes the illusion of a debt, that automatically evolves into hatred/war, people can peacefully bring the case(real life proof) a jury will look at the evidence, proof, if it can cause them and their children criminal intent, cause damage and injury, they will vote against it. a judge(most are lawyers, that debate anything for money/debt. can be bought and paid for, too vote for the highest bidder, especially when they are employed by the financial corporate legal political system. there are many court cases that a jury would have never voted what the judges voted for. all departments/institution in the legal political system are a business, what business has proof it has authority to force anything too act as its slave? is it possible for people with a jury to state they do not need some business/services? be free of any corporate legal authority. lawyers are ""legally"" bound to their law society, its a conflict of interest, serving 2 masters, that\'s impossible. lawyers are a translator, they translate their financial debt illusion language they call legalese for a debt, trying to trap presumably others in it. only with a jury trail with real life proof can there be a fair trail. all corporate courts use only presumptions, they are a presumption. they presume judges are better then a jury of people coming together with a case of real life proof. too protect and remove criminal activity being done too their real live property, especially their children.\nimagine, think a body and spirit, is love, wise, and power, able to forgive and be free?\navoid debt, the lie, be true and free.\n\npresumption of law\nimagine a parent, teacher, police, anyone, presume a child may do something they do not like. punishes the child. accuses/charges the child. takes the child\'s allowance/fines it. grounds/jails the child, then confiscates the child\'s toys/property, for something that didn\'t happen, is not real. what would happen to anything that does that too a child, to anything? put in a psychological home, to show what is the difference of anything true or a lie, real or unreal? what psychological effects would that have on the child? it can use presumptions, something not real, a lie, to take what others have, what they created?\nin the legal system did lawyers want more business? so since the corporation is a presumption of law. law is; all men, woman, children and nature. they thought its logical(its not) that they could attach presumptions too it. so if someone is doing something someone else hates, they could presume its illegal, so legally charge them with it. make more presumptions, more things illegal, more employment, more court cases, more business/clientele and more fines/profit.\n0 tolerance for statutes/presumptions, illegal to rebuttal it. \nhitler and its s.s., stalin and its k.g.b. and others, used presumptions to charge, inprison and murder men, woman, children and destroy nature.\nlet the courts use only real life proof, not a presumption with debt illusion attached, something not real, a lie.\nimagine, think a body and spirit, is love, wise, and power, able to forgive and be free?\navoid debt, the lie, be true and free.']"

The driver installer checked my hardware compatibility and installed the driver just fine, however since then the system stopped booting and ended up in BSOD every time and even safemode didn't work since it BSODed as well. The only way to fix that system was to boot up linux (windows PE would work as well) and manually find and remove the driver files from the Windows folder to get the system to boot up again. Other time I had the amd chipset driver BSOD every time i played a game with EasyAntiCheat because somehow with the anti-cheat running, the chipset driver was trying to invoke the ryzen master service that wasn't there unless you actually install Ryzen Master so the system simply BSOD. So you either had to install Ryzen Master or downgrade the chipset driver version to stop that. Ryzen Master is optional software so how was the chipset driver hardlinked to triggering it even if it's not there is mind boggling"", ""How to describe this stream?

Finatra is a lightweight web framework built on top of the Finagle networking library. Finagle is a general-purpose, protocol-agnostic RPC system developed by Twitter. It is designed to help developers create scalable, high-performance services in the JVM. Finagle and Finatra are used to build high-performance, scalable, and resilient microservices.\n\nBased on the youtube demos I've seen so far, I'm certain I could actually get started working on this. No way I'm going to replace geohot, but damn, ChatGPT is opening access to domains previously too steep. If someone has basic skills, plus very good analytical mind, they can already do more cool stuff.\n\nWhat George says about the fragility of Image cultivation is spot on.

In the process we’ve written a whole set of robotics software (messaging, kalman filters, localizer) that outperform everything available today.\n\nCome to this talk to learn how openpilot works. It’s quite sophisticated, yet still approachable. Learn the Android of self driving before everyone else.\n\n11:00AM-11:50: Harald Schäfer -- CTO\nGet the data, train the models. Easy, right?\n\nNot even close. From the world’s most sophisticated automatic ground truthing stack, to an agent trained in our “Small Offset Simulator”, you’ll learn where the magic comes from, and how the magic will continue all the way through to level 5.

You need to just get married or something. Yes inflation is bad but being honest is exactly whats been wrong with society on an economical level for almost 40 years now. Why should people put themselves thousands of dollars in debt and spend years being ""honest"" just to get rejected by a company like yours when it comes down to applying when they can be venturing into other ideas where both the individual and the client involved are both happy.

I even do not know if you read this ... anyway: On Xilinx: The UltraScale Plus Xilinx devices (ZU2,3,4,5,7,9, ...) are so called MPSOCs, so they have a hard coded SOC part (ARM cluster for application and RT, Memory Interface, GPU, and other stuff), which can run Linux and MCAL (for automotive) and the MP area is the FPGA which can be coded by verilog e.g. The devices differ by size of logic gates or/and DSP slices. DSP slices obviously work ok for matrix multiply and accumulate. But without a hardware IP supporting this you cannot deploy networks to the FPGA, I think you know that. Xilinx has used this technology for ages more in the traditional way, meaning supporting verilog code which builds up a digital logic design (whith FlipFlops, FSMs, Blockrams and whatnot by using Vivado = Xilinx synthesis and place and route). Now in the age of AI Xilinx needed to find a way how to support CNN and alike. So what they did was acquiring  a IP company which has this piece of HW IP. The company was DeePhi. That happened in 2018 and the IP is called DPU. This DPU is what Xilinx calls and Overlay Processor utilizing the DSP slices. This was integrated into Vivado and is called VITIS. To my understanding VITIS can be used with some setup also in the Amazon E2Z instances. I assume that this based in Amazon on Xilinx Artix7 FPGA, but I cant tell for sure. After Ultrascale Plus followed ACAP Versal VC1902. This a little bit an odd move but at the end it is: 1) a SOC (2x A72 plus 4x LS R52) 2) the MP area aka FPGA 3) a dedicated hardcoded AI engine, sometimes also referred as Math Engine obviously well suited to matrix multiplication. Why did the integrate this hardcoded AI enginge? Well, maybe because the FPGA way is not the best in class when it comes to efficiency? The hardware is still in bringup also at Xilinx, so the full capabilities of this combination is not yet transparent. My 2cents on this. And again, I highly honor you efforts to get in this FPGA thing, you are doing good! Your multi port (1024) architecture I do not completely understand just from the requirements ... definitely difficult to handle with standard SRAMs (dual port at the maximum) ... but I believe you could handle it with FFs ... but this is a huge waste of resources I guess and does not scale.', 'george has no patience for normies lol', 'Your wages to help him ps3 cech 3003b models do not accept hacking downgrade  ❤❤❤❤']"

As to custom hardware: Starting with Verilog or even worse with VHDL to design a custom accelerator is ""complicated"". This a whole new way of thinking. The same with the tools (professional or opensource), this tools are very complex to handle. If you intend to start to implement a design (I don\'t write ""programm"" intentionally) I would recommend to start with the tools e.g. Xilinx, Archronix or Microsemi deliver along with the FPGA. But these tools are only to tease you. You can do basic things (little projects) but you quickly (to my experience) will reach some limits. But as said doing via Verilog is tough ...\n\nIdeas: There are methodologies to start of not with a HDL but with something more highlevel. E.g. Xilinx FPGAs support HLS in the Vivado Tool Suite. HLS = High Level Synthesis. The language in use is SystemC and usually fits better to the profile of an algorithmic programmer and makes it easier for those people to jump into the topic. I cannot completely understand what you are doing with that testbench you are showing in the videos but I guess that you try to find out which architecture would fit to your (Networks) needs? I could imagine if you code the same in SystemC than you might be able to synthesize it down to the FPGA. I know that this works for typical algos like H264 decoding e.g. But honestly I dont know how this applies for your needs.\n\nUsually when it comes to AI Xilinx suggest something like VITIS AI, which is a framework (https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-ai.html) with inputs for your network (Caffe, PyTorch, TensorfLow) and deploys this to the hardware. Actually it does not synthesize your network but run your network on a pre synthezised overlay processor (DPU, DPU = DeePhi Processing Unit, an aquisition form XILINX in 2018).\n\nMay it makes sense to look into something like this: https://www.eyyes.com/en/news/eyyes-introduces-layer-processing-unit-lpu/\nTo my understanding this is now an alternative to the DPU with a different approach of doing things. The beauty of FPGA based accelerators is that the hardware is flexibel (the gates at the end) and can be adjusted to the networks. But I must admit that I don\'t know to which extend. I might know better after a meeting with eyyes this week. But that advantage has a FPGA wheras all the other designs like GPU, TPU, NPU, VPU you call it have always a sweetspot network where they perform very good, but not in all the others. So if the network technology changes ... sometimes you are screwed up ...\n\nCheers! Frank']"

The version of the axioms pa_ax1-7 that uses term variables instead of ""vars"" is admissible (could have been the axiomatization), and it would have made your life way simpler, but they are provable from the versions given in the file. The trick:\n\n* Prove the axiom of generalization, that is: from |- phi deduce |- forall x phi. This is an axiom in set.mm, and its proof in peano.mm is not obvious:\n  1. Using eq-sym or propositional logic: |- 0 = 0 -> 0 = 0\n  2. Using alpha_2: |- 0 = 0 -> A. x 0 = 0 \n  3. Using propositional logic, prove: |- 0 = 0 -> (0 = 0 <-> phi)\n  4. Using alpha_3: |- 0 = 0 -> (A. x 0 = 0 <-> A. x ph)\n  5. deduce |- A. x ph by propositional logic from steps 2 and 4.\n* Now, you want to prove |- 0 != S 0:\n  1. The axiom pa_ax1 gives you |- 0 != S x, but you can\'t directly substitute in this.\n  1. Using the above theorem, you get |- A. x (0 != S x),\n  2. Then by all_elim and modus ponens deduce |- A. x (x = 0 -> 0 != S x).\n  3. peano.mm uses this idiom A. x (x = t -> phi) to be a stand in for phi[t/x], which is what we want,\n     and all_elim3 lets us connect it to the actual substitution. It proves |- (A. x (x = 0 -> 0 != S x) -> 0 != S 0), from which we conclude |- 0 != S 0, but it has a hypothesis |- x = 0 -> (0 != S x <-> 0 != S 0).\n  4. We\'re in the home stretch. We need a lemma: |- phi -> (psi <-> chi) implies |- phi -> (not psi <-> not chi), which is proven by propositional logic.\n  5. Now we need to prove |- x = 0 -> (0 = S x <-> 0 = S 0). Now we need the lemma |- a = b -> (c = a <-> c = b), which is a couple of applications of transitivity.\n  6. Now we need to prove |- x = 0 -> S x = S 0, and this lemma is actually an axiom, eq-suc. We\'re done!\n\nThe use of polish notation for terms and propositions in that file is total garbage. set.mm notation is much easier to read, and peano.mm0 is a much saner axiomatization of PA in metamath zero.

So from the point of silicon valley which is i think typical , they are selling this device which monitors you in your car , so you don't get distracted because some really small percentage of ppl fall asleep at die in level 2 cars and they sell it as this wonderful idea without no drawbacks at all. First of all what if i don't want to be recorded on camera while i drive ? Im a grown as human who should be able to calculate the risk. Second what is this video footage used for nobody knows. Thirdly so I want to monitor myself so in case i do something wrong comma ai (a company !) has video proof of me fucking up for use in court. That is ridiculous.George talks about how he could turn comma in a insurance company, so why not use driver monitoring to evaluate the distraction level of a person to evaluate his insurance cost thath way? I would want to know how ppl would feel beeing monitored non stop in their car or their work. Driver monitoring is a reason for me not to buy such a product. I honestly think this shows that some ppl especially silicon valley lack some basic instinctual concepts of privacy and how something could be bad for their customers in a moral way.For them driver monitoring is a no brainer, montiorng somebody at his job no brainer too .

Support comma.ai at https://comma.ai/shop.', 'The weight of the vehicle specifically affects its 0-60 time. If you think about it, we only move because of friction. No friction, no movement. And friction is a function of the coefficient of friction times the normal force. One step deeper, the normal force is a function of your mass. So inversely, instead of increasing mass you could increase the coefficient of friction. I suggest this thought / perspective because it simplifies the intuition. Think about trying to run on ice, smooth metal, and rough concrete. Rough concrete wins. Mathematically, increasing the coefficient of friction is the same as increasing the normal force which is linearly dependent on mass. For those that go a little deeper, it’s not really linearly dependent on the mass, instead.. it’s linearly dependent on the downforce. So if the vehicle has more mass but somehow creates proportionally less downforce (vía vibrational design or the inherent response of the system due to a skewed mass distribution .. like having more mass in the back which creates a counter torque on the front of the car pushing it up) then you actually have less energy transfer to friction.

When a simple python or C program assignment was given out, instead of looking up the reference, I tried to figure it out on my own, \nWhen they asked to write a program if it was even or odd. I didn\'t think about mod % and tried to do it using division and iteration, and when I looked up the code on StackOverflow I felt like cheating,  ( n%2 = 0  ) but now I see you coding,  I can see it\'s OKAY to look up as long as you understand the usage. and make it yours. C programming was hard. Git, Unix, IDE... I didn\'t understand the basics.. and everything was hitting me at the same time and I was overwhelmed. I thought I was insufficient and didn\'t have the talent.  When I looked up other programmers going through tutorials on youtube, I didn\'t see them hitting the wall ( since they are explaining the concept they already mastered. )   When I saw your live slam video, It gave the hope.  I saw you pondering.. trying the different code, getting errors,  sit and just think.   I knew what I was doing was not something wrong.  Thank you. ( Obviously, you are working in a way harder problems and type way faster and navigate like a god on Vim and TMUX)  \n\nI started playing around with coding again.  I\'m starting with SQL, because It\'s relevant to my field, but all the things I learned from past classes came in handy ( syntax, think in pseudocode first, the computer read one word at a time= order matters.  how to read compiler error code. )  After finishing SQL Tutorials and finishings hackerraking challenges,  I\'m gonna revisit python and C programming while getting comfortable with command line.\n\n I heard you started the program early and probably self-thought.  Can you share how it got started for you?\n- Why did you start programming? Were you modding game? friends and family? Was there something you want to do with programming at first prior to jailbreaking?\n- Which lang did you start with? >> what did you progress to and why? \n- Any books you recommend? \n- What are some first projects you completed?  I\'m having a hard time picking a goal. some youtube built Tetris game with python... or something else.  I don\'t even understand what I can do with programming (the process, the functional limits, usage ) so it\'s hard for me to dream what I can do.   I would love to contribute to comma ai, but I think that would be years away.\n\nThank you and I think it\'s so cool you are building something like this with open source.

I feel comfort knowing that 99.9% of all life that has ever lived is dead. We are a stepping stone to something else not the answer.

Whether it be to the future life forms of this planet or to aliens visiting the solar system. \n\nI actually want it to be from future life forms on this planet to help them learn from our mistakes.

It's much cheaper clean up the current planet and let it reset than to go out and look for a place to live. \n\nWe can be wiped by anything. Nuclear war just gave us the ability to choose.

dfeoJ55EcXs,"[""really appreiciate, I'm going to apply for Google now!"", ""⟩⟩ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray... God bless you as you share this message to others."", 'Thanks sir.. your course freed me from the plethora of AI bandwagon that led to restive confusion.

u1pNrsR1txA,"['🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:\n\n00:13 📣 The video introduces a workshop on mitigating LLM hallucinations with a metrics-first evaluation framework for large language models.\n03:08 🧭 The workshop covers the need for LLM experimentation and evaluation frameworks, different evaluation methods, emerging hallucination detection metrics, and a live demo on implementing these techniques.\n14:02 📊 Existing techniques to measure hallucinations include engram matching metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, asking LLMs if they think an input/output pair is hallucinated, and using token-level confidence for statistical analysis. These techniques have limitations.\n20:29 🌟 A new technique called ChainPol is introduced to detect hallucinations more accurately and efficiently. It involves chaining and polling, using a detailed Chain of Thought prompt, and ensembling to provide a normalized score and explanation for hallucinations.\n23:28 📊 ChainPole significantly outperforms other techniques for detecting model hallucinations, especially in real-world scenarios.\n24:22 🧠 Explainability is crucial for addressing nuanced model hallucinations, as it helps make model outputs understandable to humans.\n25:18 ⏱️ Low latency and cost reduction are important considerations for practical model deployment.\n25:32 📏 ChainPole introduces metrics like ""correctness"" and ""context adherence"" to assess the reliability and relevance of model outputs in different scenarios.\n26:38 🕵️\u200d♀️ Example: A model\'s correctness score is impacted when the answer contains factual inaccuracies, and it can be identified with ChainPole\'s explanation.\n27:57 🧠 Model hallucinations can be detected by assessing context adherence, ensuring that the model\'s responses are grounded in the provided context.\n28:37 📈 ChainPole methodology shows significant improvements over other metrics like GAL, entropy, and GPT score in various tasks.\n29:19 📊 ChainPole\'s performance comes closest to human experts in determining hallucinations.\n31:10 🧪 Prompt engineering involves creating templates for interacting with language models and evaluating responses using metrics like context adherence, correctness, and latency.\n35:06 📝 Prompt sweep allows you to experiment with different prompts, models, and parameters to quickly identify the most effective combinations.\n42:08 🔄 AB testing helps compare different models and templates to determine which ones are more suitable for your application.\n44:00 🛠 Putting an application into production requires real-time monitoring of metrics like cost, latency, correctness, and user session length to ensure performance and reliability.\n45:25 🧐 Experimenting with LLMs is crucial for improving their performance. Real-time evaluation and continuous feedback loops are essential to refine LLM applications.\n47:26 🔄 Fine-tuning LLMs is cost-effective, but data quality is critical. Synthetic data tends to be low quality, so ensuring high-quality training data is essential for accurate results.\n49:20 🕵️\u200d♀️ Ground truth inspection can help identify incorrect information in LLM outputs. You can use data error potential scores to pinpoint areas that need correction.\n52:02 🤔 Uncertainty scores can help identify where LLMs struggle, helping you improve the input data to preventhallucinations.\n53:40 🔍 Defining and measuring metrics is essential for monitoring and improving LLMs. It\'s crucial to have these metrics in place before embarking on prompt engineering and fine-tuning.\n55:12 🔮 Measuring LLM hallucinations in real-time, especially in live streaming situations, can be challenging. It\'s important to have robust metrics and alerts in place to handle unforeseen issues.\n58:52 📊 The reliability of reproducing LLM results depends on various factors, including model variability. Modular systems and multiple checks can help mitigate non-deterministic behavior.\n\nMade with HARPA AI', ""I'm not a technical person, but I was interested in ChatGPT so I took the course.

Your objective is to make it easier for the recruiter to see through your resume that you have those relevant skills or have done some work in those. You have to highlight those points in your objective statement. You can also mention relevant projects or papers that you did. Or even relevant side projects that you did. Present them clearly so that recruiters can quickly connect the dots.\n17:36 - What does a recruiter sees in the resume in 7 seconds?\n=> Make the most important asks of the job description abundantly clear in the resume.\n18:13 - Large company or startup?\n=> startups - impact, challenges, getting to experience a broad spectrum of roles in ML, quicker to climb the ladder. Slower growth, small impact. At bigger companies you may become out of touch with open-source tools and knowledge. That may make it harder for you to get the next job. At startups where ML is the core, it can be really rewarding in terms of career growth and impact. In large companies you may be assigned into a team that is not good for you.\n** 24:40 - What are the Dos and don'ts during the interview process?\n=> Speaker 1:\nPrepare on technical interviews. Prepare to talk about your contributions and impacts in your past works. Ask questions.\nQuestions: How are technical decisions are made? How is the engineering culture?\nDon'ts. If you don't know the answer then don't waste time. Accept that you don't know. But do reply how you would solve the problem if you faced now.\nDo take feedback and listen to your recruiters. They do want someone who reacts to feedback positively.\n=> Speaker 2:\nShowing curiosity, creativity, knowledge of open-source or available tech. Showing potential is important. It is okay that you don't have all the perfect skills for the job.\n=> Speaker 3:\nQuestions: What are differences between a ML Engineer and a applied ML Researcher at this company?

It is better to show that you are an AI + X (where X is your T shape expertise. E.g. I am a data scientist with expertise in NLP, ""I am a data analyst with expertise in Marketing"" as the companies are looking for someone who knows data engineering in general but also knows one domain well. \n\n3.

What you\'re doing is using this fixed function, in this first part of the neural network, to take this input any image X and compute some feature vector for it and then you\'re training a shallow softmax model from this feature vector to make a prediction. One step that could help your computation as you just precompute that layers activation, for all the examples in training sets and save them to disk and then just train the softmax clause right on top of that. The advantage of the save to disk or the pre-compute method or the save to disk is that you don\'t need to recompute those activations every time you take a epoch or take a post through a training set.

Then the network is free to gradually adapt itself (hopefully by reducing train-set overfit and generalizing) as to push that layer into being evermore so of an identity one. Then if that layer manages to be an identity, it can be permanently shutdown.\nThis could be a way to reduce the network size, and maybe could automatically be applied on high variance with low bias.\n\nAs far as linear Z functions go, one way for a layer to be an identity is if it has the same amount of nodes as inputs, and if you make a cost for each node[j] so that only their weight[j] is 1 while all other weights are 0, so this would be similar to a ""identity"" Z layer. But I think that trying to make the activation function also an identity is a hassle, but even ignoring the activation function, if you could still manage to just shutdown the Z function nodes and stack the posterior activation back into the previous activation, that would already be a network simplification.\n\nEdit: We also could try to simplify the activation functions if we generalize them and re-parametrize them. Eg. for a ReLU activation function, we could turn it into a leaky ReLU where the leaky-side parameter starts at zero (so it\'s just like  normal ReLU), then we add a cost of that parameter being zero and we let backprop start pushing it towards 1, in which case that previously ReLU activation has turned into the identity activation, which can them be gracefully shutdown.', '((()))', 'Thank you !', ""Just a question for those out there - has anyone been able to use techniques from ResNets to improve the convergence speed of deep fully connected networks?

-342RkdEb8g,"[""There are several methods for solving linear equations, each with its own strengths and limitations. Here are three commonly used methods:\r\n\r\nSubstitution Method:\r\n\r\nIn this method, you solve one equation for one variable and substitute that expression into the other equation.\r\nThe substitution method is relatively straightforward and can be used for systems of linear equations with any number of variables.\r\nHowever, it can become tedious and time-consuming for complex systems involving many variables.\r\n\n\nElimination Method (also known as the Addition/Subtraction Method):\r\n\r\nIn this method, you manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations.\r\nThe elimination method is efficient for systems of linear equations with two variables and can lead to a quicker solution compared to substitution.\r\nHowever, it may become more challenging when dealing with systems involving three or more variables.\r\n\nMatrix Method (also known as the Matrix Algebra Method or Gaussian Elimination):\r\n\r\nThe matrix method involves representing the system of equations in matrix form and using matrix operations to solve for the variables.\r\nThis method is particularly useful for systems with a large number of equations and variables.\r\nThe matrix method provides a systematic approach and can be easily programmed for computational solutions.\r\nHowever, it requires a good understanding of matrix operations and can be computationally intensive for larger systems.\r\n\nBenefits of these methods:\r\n\r\nThey provide systematic approaches to solve linear equations and can be applied to a wide range of problems.\r\nThey allow for the identification of unique solutions, infinite solutions, or no solution.\r\nThey are widely taught and understood, making them accessible to students and practitioners.\r\n\n\nLimitations of these methods:\r\n\r\nThese methods are specifically designed for solving linear equations and may not be applicable to other types of equations.\r\nThey can become complex and time-consuming for systems with many variables or equations.\r\nWhen dealing with large systems, computational limitations may arise, requiring specialized algorithms or software.\r\nOverall, the choice of method depends on the complexity of the linear equations and the specific requirements of the problem at hand. It's essential to consider the limitations and benefits of each method to select the most appropriate approach for solving a particular system of linear equations."", ""What are the methods to solve system equations?\r\n\r\nThere are several methods to solve system equations which are following:\r\n\r\n1) Substitution Method:\r\n\tIn this method, we solve one equation and solve the equation with respect to one variable and put that variable into other equations to find the exact value of one varaible. This resultant variable then put into one of the system equation and find other variable values.\r\n\r\n1.1) Limitaion:\r\n\tThis method is easy to solve for 2 or 3 variables but can be difficult for big equations and chances of errors increased. Also this method is time consuming.\r\n\r\n2) Elimination Method:\r\n\tIn this method, first we equal co-efficinet of variables then add or substract one equation from another equation to find the values of one varibale. We then put that variable to one of the system equations to find the remaining variables.\r\n\r\n2.2) Limitaions:\r\n\tThis method may not work well when co-efficient of variales are large.\r\n\r\n3) Matrix Methods:\r\n\tIn this method, we convert system equation into matrix form in which three matrices are involved including co-efficient matrix, variable matrix and constant matrix. Then we solve these matrices by using different methods like Gaussian Elimination Method, Gauss-Jordan Elimination Method and Matrix Inverse.\r\n\r\n3.3) Limitation:\r\n\tThese 3 methods can be computationality intensive for large system especially when matrix inversion involved.\r\n\r\n4) Cramer's Rule:\r\n\tIn this method, we use determinents to find the solution of system equation.\r\n\r\n4.4) Limitation:\r\n\tAs Cramer's rule involved computing multiple determinents, so it can be expensive for large system of equations."", ""How to solve System of equations and their limitations and benefits:\n1. Elimination Method\r\nThis method involves eliminating one of the variables by adding or subtracting the equations in such a way that the coefficients of one variable cancel out. This method is particularly useful when the coefficients of one variable are opposites or inverses of each other.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nThe elimination method can be inefficient for large systems of equations.\r\nIt is not as effective when the coefficients are not in a convenient form for elimination.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nThe elimination method is simple and straightforward to apply.\r\nIt is particularly useful when the coefficients of one variable are opposites or inverses of each other.\r\n\n2. Substitution Method\r\nThis method involves solving one equation for one variable and substituting that value into the other equation. This method is particularly useful when one of the variables is already isolated or can be easily isolated.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nThe substitution method can be inefficient for systems where one variable is not easily isolated.\r\nIt may not be suitable if the equations are not in a form where one variable can be directly solved for.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nThe substitution method is straightforward and easy to understand.\r\nIt is particularly useful when one of the variables is already isolated or can be easily isolated.\r\n\n3. Graphical Method\r\nThis method involves plotting the equations on a coordinate plane and finding the point where the lines intersect. This method is particularly useful when the equations are linear and the solution can be easily visualized.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nThe graphical method is not accurate for systems with more than two variables.\r\nIt can be difficult to visualize and interpret complex graphical solutions.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nThe graphical method provides a visual representation of the solutions.\r\nIt is particularly useful when the equations are linear and the solution can be easily visualized.\r\n\n4. Matrix Method\r\nThis method involves representing the system of equations in matrix form and using matrix operations to solve for the solution. This method is particularly useful when dealing with systems of three or more equations.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nThe matrix method can be computationally demanding for large systems of equations.\r\nIt requires a basic understanding of matrix operations.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nThe matrix method is a systematic and efficient approach for solving systems of equations.\r\nIt can be easily generalized to systems with more than three variables.\r\n\n5. Gaussian Elimination\r\nThis method involves transforming the system of equations into an upper triangular matrix and then back-solving to find the solution. This method is a more efficient version of Gaussian elimination and is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nGaussian elimination can be tedious and error-prone for large systems of equations.\r\nIt is not as efficient as LU decomposition or other advanced methods.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nGaussian elimination is a straightforward and widely taught method for solving systems of linear equations.\r\nIt is particularly useful for systems of equations with a small number of variables.\r\n\n6. LU Decomposition\r\nThis method involves factoring the coefficient matrix into a product of an upper triangular matrix (U) and a lower triangular matrix (L). The solution is then found by solving the system of equations Ly = b and Ux = y. This method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations that have a sparse coefficient matrix.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nLU decomposition requires a basic understanding of matrices and matrix operations.\r\nIt can be computationally expensive for large systems of equations.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nLU decomposition is a powerful method for solving systems of linear equations.\r\nIt is particularly efficient for systems of equations with a sparse coefficient matrix.\r\n\n7. Crout's Method\r\nThis method is a variant of LU decomposition that involves solving the system of equations Ly = d and Ux = y, where d is a vector of constants. This method is particularly useful when dealing with systems of equations that have a square coefficient matrix.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nCrout's method requires a basic understanding of matrices and matrix operations.\r\nIt can be computationally expensive for large systems of equations.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nCrout's method is a more efficient alternative to Gaussian elimination for some systems of equations.\r\nIt is particularly well-suited for systems of equations with a square coefficient matrix.\r\n\n8. Doolittle's Method\r\nThis method is another variant of LU decomposition that involves solving the system of equations Ly = d and Ux = y, where d is a vector of constants. This method is particularly useful when dealing with systems of equations that have a triangular coefficient matrix.\r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\nDoolittle's method requires a basic understanding of matrices and matrix operations.\r\nIt can be computationally expensive for large systems of equations.\r\n\nBenefits:\r\nDoolittle's method is a more"", ""How can one solve a system of equations, and what are the advantages and limitations of each method used in the process?\n\nGraphing Method:\n\nPlot the equations on a graph and look for the points of intersection.\nBenefits: Graphing provides a visual representation of the system of equations, making it easier to identify the solutions.\nLimitations: Graphing may not yield precise solutions, especially if the points of intersection are not easily identifiable. It is also not practical for complex systems with more variables.\n\nSubstitution Method:\n\nSolve one equation for one variable and substitute it into the other equation(s).\nBenefits: The substitution method is straightforward and useful when one equation can be easily solved for one variable.\nLimitations: This method can be time-consuming, especially if the equations are complex or involve fractions. It may also become more challenging when dealing with systems with many variables.\n\nElimination Method:\n\nAdd or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the other.\nBenefits: The elimination method is effective when adding or subtracting the equations allows you to eliminate one variable and solve for the other.\nLimitations: This method can become more complex and cumbersome when dealing with equations that have coefficients that are fractions or decimals. It may also require careful manipulation to ensure the elimination process is successful.\n\nMatrix Method (Cramer's Rule):\n\nSet up a matrix representing the coefficients of the variables and use determinants to solve for each variable.\nBenefits: The matrix method (Cramer's Rule) is a systematic approach that can be used to solve systems of equations with any number of variables.\nLimitations: This method becomes computationally intensive and impractical for larger systems of equations, as it involves calculating determinants and matrix inversions.\n\nGaussian Elimination (Row Echelon Form):\n\nConvert the system of equations into row echelon form and back-substitute to find the solutions.\nBenefits: Gaussian elimination provides a systematic and efficient way of solving systems of equations, especially when dealing with larger systems.\nLimitations: Gaussian elimination requires careful bookkeeping and may involve complex arithmetic operations, making it prone to errors. It is also not suitable for systems that have no unique solutions or inconsistent equations.\n\nIterative Methods (e.g., Gauss-Seidel or Jacobi):\n\nStart with initial guesses for the variables and iteratively update the values until convergence.\nBenefits: Iterative methods are useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as they can be computationally efficient and require less memory.\nLimitations: Iterative methods may not always converge to a solution, especially if the system is ill-conditioned or the initial guess is far from the actual solution. They may also require more computational resources compared to other methods."", 'Sir calculus pe video kb bna rahe hai please bta do']"

GCD of 45 & 75 is 15. \r\n   2. GCD of 22 & 33 is 11.\r\n   3. GCD of 18 & 24 is 6.\r\n   4. To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1145 and 360, we can use the Euclidean algorithm.\r\n\r\n   Step 1: Divide 1145 by 360. The quotient is 3 and the remainder is 65.\r\n   Step 2: Divide 360 by 65. The quotient is 5 and the remainder is 35.\r\n   Step 3: Divide 65 by 35. The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 30.\r\n   Step 4: Divide 35 by 30. The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 5.\r\n   Step 5: Divide 30 by 5. The quotient is 6 and the remainder is 0.\r\n\r\nSince the remainder is 0, we stop the algorithm. The GCD of 1145 and 360 is the last non-zero remainder, which is 5.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the GCD of 1145 and 360 is 5.\r\n   \r\n2.  least common multiple(LCM): LCM of two numbers is the smallest number i.e a mulyiple of both numbers.\r\n   1.

Calculate the GCD of 24 and 36.\r\n         The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3.\r\n         The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 * 3^2.\r\n         The common factors are 2^2 * 3 = 12.\r\n         The GCD(24, 36) = 12.\r\n      2. Use the formula LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).\r\n         LCM(24, 36) = (24 * 36) / 12 = 72.\r\n         Therefore, the LCM of 24 and 36 is 72.\r\n\r\n>>> B) Modular Arithmetic: ""a ≡ b (mod n)""\r\n\r\n1. definition: is the modulus a specific number that sets the threshold for wrapping around. it acts like a reset point, beyond which numbers revert back to a set range.\r\n\r\n2. definition: Modular arithmetic is a mathematical system that deals with the remainder when one number is divided by another. It\'s often represented using the notation ""a ≡ b (mod n),"" where ""a"" is the number, ""b"" is the remainder, and ""n"" is the modulus. It\'s used in various fields, including number theory, cryptography, and computer science.\r\n\r\n3. example: Let\'s say we want to calculate 23 mod 7. This means we want to find the remainder when 23 is divided by 7.\r\nUsing modular arithmetic notation:\r\n23 ≡ 2 (mod 7)\r\nSo, in this example, the result is 2, as that\'s the remainder when 23 is divided by 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n>>> C).

Let's explore each of these arrays and their significance in data science:\r\n\r\n1D Arrays (One-Dimensional Arrays):\r\n\r\nUse in Data Science: 1D arrays are frequently used to represent one-dimensional data, such as time series data, financial data, or any data that can be arranged in a linear sequence. They are handy for tasks like storing feature vectors, time series analysis, and implementing simple data structures like lists or queues.\r\n\r\n2D Arrays (Two-Dimensional Arrays):\r\n\r\nUse in Data Science: 2D arrays are essential for storing and manipulating structured data. In data science, you often work with datasets in tabular form, such as spreadsheets or CSV files. These arrays are used for data frames, which are widely used in libraries like Pandas in Python. They are also used in image processing, where each element can represent a pixel's value, or in representing data for machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines.\r\n\r\n3D Arrays (Three-Dimensional Arrays):\r\n\r\nUse in Data Science: 3D arrays are less common but are useful in cases where you have multi-dimensional data, such as video data, spatio-temporal data, or MRI scans. In data science, they can be used for representing data with three different attributes or dimensions, which require more complex data structures and algorithms to analyze.\r\n\r\nIn data science, the choice of array dimensionality depends on the nature of the data and the specific analysis or processing you intend to perform. You use 1D arrays for sequences, 2D arrays for structured data, and 3D arrays for more complex, multi-dimensional data. These arrays serve as fundamental building blocks for many data manipulation and analysis tasks, making it easier to organize, process, and analyze data efficiently"", 'Great sir g', '*Assigmnet Day 28:*\r\n\r\n*Why we have 1D,2D and 3D arrays and where we need them in data science? *\n\r\nAn array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each \r\nidentified by at least one array index or key.\r\n\r\nThere are three maintypes of arrays:\r\n\nOne-dimensional array (1-D arrays).\r\nTwo-dimensional (2D) array.\r\nThree-dimensional array.\r\n\r\n*1.

Data Science\n\nData scientists use programming, math, and statistics to gain insights and drive organizational strategy. Data scientists are highly adept at machine learning, data modeling, and the use of algorithms to automate processes. Since meaningful data is field-specific, data scientists also must have domain expertise, the understanding of their industry or company, to provide context for the data they work with. For example, data science research in healthcare can drive diagnoses, help prevent disease, or teach computers to read X-rays or MRIs.\r\nData scientists work closely with sales and marketing, product development, information technology, finance, and business leaders to help identify trends, spot issues, understand consumer behavior, and present solutions that support strategic decision-making.\n\n3. Data Analytics\n\nData analytics professionals are responsible for data collection, organization, and maintenance, as well as for using statistics, programming, and other techniques to gain insights from data. The role of a data analyst is to spot trends and help solve problems.

Following is flow diagram which explain the types of AI.\r\n \r\n\r\nLarge language models are the dynamite behind the generative AI boom of 2023. However, they\'ve been around for a while.\r\nLLMs are black box AI systems that use deep learning on extremely large datasets to understand and generate new text. Modern LLMs began taking shape in 2014 when the attention mechanism -- a machine learning technique designed to mimic human cognitive attention -- was introduced in a research paper titled ""Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate."" In 2017, that attention mechanism was honed with the introduction of the transformer model in another paper, ""Attention Is All You Need.""\r\nTop current LLMs\r\nBelow are some of the most relevant large language models today. They do natural language processing and influence the architecture of future models.\r\nBERT\r\nBERT is a family of LLMs that Google introduced in 2018. BERT is a transformer-based model that can convert sequences of data to other sequences of data. BERT\'s architecture is a stack of transformer encoders and features 342 million parameters. BERT was pre-trained on a large corpus of data then fine-tuned to perform specific tasks along with natural language inference and sentence text similarity. It was used to improve query understanding in the 2019 iteration of Google search.\r\nClaude\r\nThe Claude LLM focuses on constitutional AI, which shapes AI outputs guided by a set of principles that help the AI assistant it powers helpful, harmless and accurate. Claude was created by the company Anthropic and powers its two main product offerings: Claude Instant and Claude 2. Claude 2 excels at complex reasoning according to Anthropic.\r\nCohere\r\nCohere is an enterprise LLM that can be custom-trained and fine-tuned to a specific company’s use case. The company that created the Cohere LLM was founded by one of the authors of Attention Is All You Need. One of Cohere’s strengths is that it is not tied to one single cloud -- unlike OpenAI, which is bound to Microsoft Azure.\r\nFalcon 40B\r\nFalcon 40B is a transformer-based, causal decoder-only model developed by the Technology Innovation Institute. It is open source and was trained on English data. The model is available in two smaller variants as well: Falcon 1B and Falcon 7B (1 billion and 7 billion parameters). Amazon has made Falcon 40B available on Amazon SageMaker. It is also available for free on GitHub.\r\nGalactica\r\nJust three days into its public release in November 2022, Galactica was Meta\'s LLM designed specifically for scientists. It was trained on a collection of academic material -- 48 million papers, lecture notes, textbooks and websites. As most models do, it produced AI ""hallucinations"" that members of the scientific community deemed unsafe because they sounded authoritative. This made them hard to detect quickly and were generated in a domain that requires little margin for error.\r\nGPT-3\r\nGPT-3 is OpenAI\'s large language model with more than 175 billion parameters, released in 2020. GPT-3 uses a decoder-only transformer architecture. In September 2022, Microsoft announced it had exclusive use of GPT-3\'s underlying model. GPT-3 is 10 times larger than its predecessor. GPT-3\'s training data includes Common Crawl, WebText2, Books1, Books2 and Wikipedia.\r\nGPT-3 is the last of the GPT series of models in which OpenAI made the parameter counts publicly available. The GPT series was first introduced in 2018 with OpenAI\'s paper ""Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training.""\r\nGPT-3.5\r\nGPT-3.5 is an upgraded version of GPT-3 with fewer parameters. GPT-3.5 was fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback. GPT-3.5 is the version of GPT that powers ChatGPT. There are several models, with GPT-3.5 turbo being the most capable, according to OpenAI. GPT-3.5\'s training data extends to September 2021.\r\nIt was also integrated into the Bing search engine but has since been replaced with GPT-4.\r\nGPT-4\r\nGPT-4 is the largest model in OpenAI\'s GPT series, released in 2023. Like the others, it\'s a transformer-based model. Unlike the others, its parameter count has not been released to the public, though there are rumors that the model has more than 170 trillion. OpenAI describes GPT-4 as a multimodal model, meaning it can process and generate both language and images as opposed to being limited to only language. GPT-4 also introduced a system message, which lets users specify tone of voice and task.\r\nGPT-4 demonstrated human-level performance in multiple academic exams. At the model\'s release, some speculated that GPT-4 came close to artificial general intelligence (AGI), which means it is as smart or smarter than a human. GPT-4 powers Microsoft Bing search, is available in ChatGPT Plus and will eventually be integrated into Microsoft Office products.\r\nLamda\r\nLamda (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is a family of LLMs developed by Google Brain announced in 2021. Lamda used a decoder-only transformer language model and was pre-trained on a large corpus of text. In 2022, LaMDA gained widespread attention when then-Google engineer Blake Lemoine went public with claims that the program was sentient. It was built on the Seq2Seq architecture.\r\nLlama\r\nLarge Language Model Meta AI (Llama) is Meta\'s LLM released in 2023. The largest version is 65 billion parameters in size. Llama was originally released to approved researchers and developers but is now open source. Llama comes in smaller sizes that require less computing power to use, test and experiment with.\r\nLlama uses a transformer architecture and was trained on a variety of public data sources, including webpages from CommonCrawl, GitHub, Wikipedia and Project Gutenberg. Llama was effectively leaked and spawned many descendants, including Vicuna and Orca.\r\nOrca\r\nOrca was developed by Microsoft and has 13 billion parameters, meaning it\'s small enough to run on a laptop. It aims to improve on advancements made by other open source models by imitating the reasoning procedures achieved by LLMs. Orca achieves the same performance as GPT-4 with significantly fewer parameters and is on par with GPT-3.5 for many tasks. Orca is built on top of the 13 billion parameter version of LLaMA.\r\nPalm\r\nThe Pathways Language Model is a 540 billion parameter transformer-based model from Google powering its AI chatbot Bard. It was trained across multiple TPU 4 Pods -- Google\'s custom hardware for machine learning. Palm specializes in reasoning tasks such as coding, math, classification and question answering. Palm also excels at decomposing complex tasks into simpler subtasks.\r\nPaLM gets its name from a Google research initiative to build Pathways, ultimately creating a single model that serves as a foundation for multiple use cases. There are several fine-tuned versions of Palm, including Med-Palm 2 for life sciences and medical information as well as Sec-Palm for cybersecurity deployments to speed up threat analysis.\r\nPhi-1\r\nPhi-1 is a transformer-based language model from Microsoft. At just 1.3 billion parameters, Phi-1 was trained for four days on a collection of textbook-quality data. Phi-1 is an example of a trend toward smaller models trained on better quality data and synthetic data.\r\n""We\'ll probably see a lot more creative scaling down work: prioritizing data quality and diversity over quantity, a lot more synthetic data generation, and small but highly capable expert models,"" wrote Andrej Karpathy, former director of AI at Tesla and OpenAI employee, in a tweet.\r\nPhi-1 specializes in Python coding and has fewer general capabilities because of its smaller size.\r\nStableLM\r\nStableLM is a series of open source language models developed by Stability AI, the company behind image generator Stable Diffusion. There are 3 billion and 7 billion parameter models available and 15 billion, 30 billion, 65 billion and 175 billion parameter models in progress at time of writing. StableLM aims to be transparent, accessible and supportive.\r\nVicuna 33B\r\nVicuna is another influential open source LLM derived from Llama. It was developed by LMSYS and was fine-tuned using data from sharegpt.com. It is smaller and less capable that GPT-4 according to several benchmarks, but does well for a model of its size. Vicuna has only 33 billion parameters, whereas GPT-4 has trillions.\r\nLLM precursors\r\nAlthough LLMs are a recent phenomenon, their precursors go back decades. Learn how recent precursor Seq2Seq and distant precursor ELIZA set the stage for modern LLMs.\r\nSeq2Seq\r\nSeq2Seq is a deep learning approach used for machine translation, image captioning and natural language processing. It was developed by Google and underlies some of their modern LLMs, including LaMDA. Seq2Seq also underlies AlexaTM 20B, Amazon\'s large language model. It uses a mix of encoders and decoders.\r\nEliza\r\nEliza was an early natural language processing program created in 1966. It is one of the earliest examples of a language model. Eliza simulated conversation using pattern matching and substitution. Eliza, running a certain script, could parody the interaction between a patient and therapist by applying weights to certain keywords and responding to the user accordingly. The creator of Eliza, Joshua Weizenbaum, wrote a book on the limits of computation and artificial intelligence.', 'Assignment #2\r\n\r\nWhat Does a Data Analyst Do?\r\nA data analyst typically gathers data to identify trends that help business leaders make strategic decisions. The discipline is focused on performing statistical analyses to help answer questions and solve problems. A data analyst uses tools such as SQL to make queries to relational databases. A data analyst may also clean data, or put it in a usable format, discarding irrelevant or unusable information or figuring out how to deal with missing data.\r\nA data analyst typically works as part of an interdisciplinary team to determine the organization’s goals and then manage the process of mining, cleaning and analyzing the data. The data analyst uses programming languages like R and SAS, visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau, and communication skills to develop and convey their findings.\r\nWhat Does a Data Scientist Do?\r\nA data scientist will typically be more involved with designing data modeling processesExternal link:open_in_new, creating algorithms and predictive models. Therefore, data scientists may spend more time designing tools, automation systems and data frameworks.\r\nCompared to a data analyst, a data scientist may be more focused on developing new tools and methods to extract the information the organization requires to solve complex problems. It’s also beneficial to possess business intuition and critical-thinking skills to understand the implications of the data. Some in the field might describe a data scientist as someone who not only has mathematical and statistical knowledge but also the skills of a hacker to approach problems in innovative ways.\r\nDifferences and Similarities Between Data Analyst and Data Scientist\r\nBoth career paths require at least a bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field such as mathematics, computer science or statistics.\r\nA data analyst may spend more time on routine analysis, providing reports regularly. A data scientist may design the way data is stored, manipulated and analyzed. Simply put, a data analyst makes sense out of existing data, whereas a data scientist works on new ways of capturing and analyzing data to be used by the analysts.\r\nIf you love numbers and statistics as well as computer programming, either path could be a good fit for your career goals. An analyst typically works on answering specific questions about the organization’s business. A data scientist may work at a more macro level to develop new ways of asking and answering important questions.\r\nAlthough each role is focused on analyzing data to gain actionable insights for their organization, they’re sometimes defined by the tools they use. It helps data analysts to be proficient with relational database software, business intelligence programs and statistical software. Data scientists tend to use Python, Java and machine learning to manipulate and analyze data.', 'Assignment #1\r\nWhat Is Data Science?\r\nData Science is the application of tools, processes, and techniques such as programming, statistics, machine learning and algorithms towards combining, preparing and examining large datasets. The datasets are often a mix of structured and unstructured data.\r\nThe goal of data science is often to identify patterns and develop actionable insights but it can also be to produce broad insights by asking questions, finding the right questions to ask and identifying areas to study. Other examples of data science deliverables include recommendations based on collaborative filtering, predictions and forecasts based on prior activity, segmentation based on defining attributes, fraud detection based on identifying anomalies and automated decision making based on model parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Is Data Analytics?\r\nLike data science, data analytics is the use of tools and processes to combine and examine datasets to identify patterns and develop actionable insights. And, like data science, the goal is to help organizations make better, data-driven decisions. The key difference is that for data analytics, the focus is typically much more on answering specific questions than open exploration.', 'Assignment #2\n𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐭 𝐕𝐬 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐬\n 𝐀 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐬:  :   \n\r\n1.

It cannot perform multiple tasks. Examples of ANI are….. ChatGPT, Bard & Self Driving Cars. You might be wondering that  Self Driving Cars can perform multiple tasks such as breaking. Accelerating and on the same time it connects to GPS than how it is the example of ANI. The answer is that,  In Self Driving Cars multiples models are used which are trained on multiple things. So that's why it can perform multiple tasks at a time\nNow AGI can is such type of AI that can perform multiple tasks at a time just like humans brains. it is still under development that's why there is no example of AGI.\n\n\nQs No 3: What are large language models(LLMs)?\nAns: LLMs are just like  computer program that trains on massive data set to generate humans like content. It can understand human language and also generate answer based on the data set. In theses models, Reinforcement learning techniques are used to make the models more accurate\nLLM names of big Giants:\nGoogle --> Palm 2\nApple ---> AJAX\nMicrosoft --->Turning NLG\nopenAI ---> ChatGPT\nFaceBook ---> Llama 2\n\nSir, thanks for considering.\nMuhammad Asfar"", 'What is m & d learning and how', 'Tasla mean India ne Tasla ka Sath contract kyea but hmra pasa Tasla arse se majood ha Jo la ka jata ha baqi countries se mangna ka lyea', 'Both maaaaar pari ha', 'thank you itna complex syllabus itna easily cover krwane ke liye', 'Kindly share ppt notes that you are representing in videos', ""How will you prepare people job ready ?

Better to learn how to implement machine learning by developing your own algorithms. Machine learning or deep learning are just for those people who are experts in their domain knowledge like Doctors, engineers etc. but if you want to become an ALGORITHMIC MACHINE LEARNING PROGRAMMER OR CODER then better to focus on how to develop and implement machine learning algos. IMPLEMENT ALGOS, WIRTE CODE FOR ALGOS. WE SHOULD MORE FOCUS ON HOW TO DEVELOPE OUR OWN ALGOs. To do this you should first learn Linear Algebra, Functions,Statistics,Differentiation, Derivatives and more.\nAbout features engineering, select those features having ACCEPTABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OUTPUT (YOUR FINAL GOAL) because at the end ALGOS have to go for CURVE, FUNCTION OR BEST FIT.\nRemember: Companies are developing different kinds of ALGOS and the ultimate purpose of developing algos is to make them intelligent so that they can be able to do INFERENCE. INFERENCE IS NEVER POSSIBLE ON JUST NON-LINEAR COMPLEX FEATURES AND LABELS  and that is why at the end modellers try their best to find out relationships within the data. If ACCEPTABLE RELATIONSHIP is there then we can do inference otherwise we can never do prediction.\nOBS: Features having relationships are the fundamental units (CELLS) for your algos which will decide how intelligent AN HUMAN BEING WILL BE BORN......

This is the ideal clustering, but it is NP-hard to find, meaning that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for finding it.', 'Global Optima definition:    A local minimum of a function is a point where the function value is smaller than or equal to the value at nearby points, but possibly greater than at a distant point.', 'Global optima is the best possible clustering solution. It is the solution that minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) error.', 'Definition of Global Optima: \nIn the K-means it represents the ideal arrangement of data points into clusters. \n\nThe algorithm works by iteratively updating the cluster assignments of data points to minimize the overall distance between the data points and their respective cluster centroids.\n\nThe global optima is reached when the algorithm finds the optimal set of cluster centroids and assignments that minimizes this distance and produces the most accurate and meaningful clusters. It ensures that the clusters are well-separated and the data points within each cluster are as similar as possible.\n\nFor EXAMPLE: you have a big box of colored toys, and you want to organize them by color. K-means helps us figure out the best way to group the toys so that toys of the same color stay together. The global optima is like finding the perfect arrangement where all the toys of the same color are in their own group and not mixed with other colors.']"

Imagine you have a jar full of candies, and you want to choose some candies randomly. To do this, you close your eyes, and you pick some candies from the jar without looking at them. This is how simple random sampling works. You choose some items from a group without any specific order or pattern.\r\n\r\nStratified random sampling:\r\nThis is like picking candies from different jars. Imagine you have different jars, each one with different types of candies. To make sure you get a good mix of candies, you pick some candies from each jar. This is how stratified random sampling works. You divide the group into smaller groups or strata and then randomly select from each group to ensure that you get a representative sample from each stratum.\r\n\r\nCluster sampling:\r\nThis is like picking candies from a few jars. Imagine you have many jars, but you don't have time to pick candies from each jar. Instead, you pick a few jars randomly and take all the candies from those jars. This is how cluster sampling works. You divide the group into clusters, then randomly select a few clusters, and take a sample from each cluster.\r\n\r\nSystematic sampling:\r\nThis is like picking candies from a jar with a pattern. Imagine you have a jar full of candies, and you want to pick every third candy. To do this, you count the candies and pick every third candy until you have the desired number of candies. This is how systematic sampling works. You pick items from the group with a fixed pattern or interval.\r\n\r\nMultistage sampling:\r\nThis is like picking candies from many jars, but only some jars have more jars inside them. Imagine you have jars inside jars, and you want to pick some candies from each jar. To do this, you randomly select some jars from the big jars and then randomly select some jars from the small jars inside those big jars. This is how multistage sampling works.

XZXmK3D_5-A,"[""41:00*Q: Is df.index a function? _*\r\n\r\nNo, df.index is not a function; it is an attribute of a Pandas DataFrame. In Python, attributes are variables associated with an object, and they provide information or access to specific characteristics or properties of that object. In the case of Pandas DataFrames, df.index is used to access and manipulate the index of the DataFrame.\r\n\r\nHere's the difference between an attribute and a function:\r\n\r\nAttribute: An attribute is a variable associated with an object that provides information about the object or access to certain properties. You access attributes without using parentheses. For example, df.index is used to access the index of a DataFrame.\r\n\r\nFunction (Method): A function, or method, is a piece of code that can be executed on an object. Functions are called using parentheses, and they perform actions or operations. For example, df.head() is a function that returns the first few rows of a DataFrame.\r\n\r\nSo, when you see df.index, it's referring to the index attribute of the DataFrame df. It provides information about the index of the DataFrame, and you can use it to access and manipulate the index labels._"", 'Correction at 1:06:50. In iloc, the last value is not included.

It's often employed for tasks such as classification, clustering, and data exploration. This dataset contains information about different species of iris flowers. Here's an explanation of the Iris flower dataset and its columns:\r\n\r\n**Columns in the Iris Dataset**:\r\n\r\n1. **Sepal Length (cm)**: This column represents the length of the sepals, which are the outermost whorls of the flower. Sepals are usually green and protect the inner flower parts.\r\n\r\n2. **Sepal Width (cm)**: This column represents the width of the sepals.\r\n\r\n3. **Petal Length (cm)**: This column represents the length of the petals. Petals are the colorful, inner parts of the flower.\r\n\r\n4. **Petal Width (cm)**: This column represents the width of the petals.\r\n\r\n5. **Species**: This column indicates the species of the iris flower. It's the target variable, and there are three species in the dataset: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.\r\n\r\nThe Iris dataset is typically used for supervised learning tasks, where the goal is to predict the species of the iris flower (the target variable) based on the measurements of sepal and petal length and width. It is a small, well-understood dataset, making it an excellent choice for educational purposes, testing and demonstrating various machine learning algorithms, and practicing data analysis techniques.\r\n\r\nThe Iris dataset is available in many machine learning libraries and is commonly used for tasks such as classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It's often one of the first datasets that data scientists and machine learning practitioners work with to learn the ropes of data analysis and model building."", '19:04 \nThe Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used for data analysis and machine learning. It contains information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived or not. Here are some of the key columns in the Titanic dataset:\r\n\r\n1. **Survived**: This column indicates whether a passenger survived or not. It\'s a binary variable with values 0 (did not survive) and 1 (survived).\r\n\r\n2. **Pclass (Passenger Class)**: This column represents the passenger class, which is a proxy for the socio-economic status of the passengers. It\'s divided into three categories: 1st class, 2nd class, and 3rd class.\r\n\r\n3. **Name**: This column contains the names of the passengers.\r\n\r\n4. **Sex**: It represents the gender of the passengers, with values ""male"" and ""female.""\r\n\r\n5. **Age**: This column contains the age of the passengers.\r\n\r\n6. **SibSp (Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard)**: It indicates the number of siblings or spouses a passenger had on board.\r\n\r\n7. **Parch (Number of Parents/Children Aboard)**: This column represents the number of parents or children a passenger had on board.\r\n\r\n8. **Ticket**: This column contains the ticket number of each passenger.\r\n\r\n9. **Fare**: It represents the fare paid by each passenger.\r\n\r\n10. **Cabin**: This column contains the cabin number of the passengers. It\'s worth noting that this column has many missing values.\r\n\r\n11. **Embarked**: It indicates the port of embarkation for each passenger, with three possible values: ""C"" for Cherbourg, ""Q"" for Queenstown, and ""S"" for Southampton.\r\n\r\n12. **PassengerId**: An identifier for each passenger, which can be used to uniquely identify individuals in the dataset.\r\n\r\nThese are the main columns in the Titanic dataset. The dataset is often used for tasks like predicting whether a passenger survived based on other features, exploring the demographics of the passengers, and studying the factors that influenced survival rates during the Titanic\'s ill-fated voyage in 1912.

The value of ""k"" is chosen by the user, and the predictions are made using a majority vote of the labels of the nearest neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn summary, k-means clustering is used for unsupervised learning, while k-NN is used for supervised learning.', 'K-NN is a Supervised machine learning while K-means is an unsupervised machine learning.\nK-NN is a classification or regression machine learning algorithm while K-means is a clustering machine learning algorithm.\nK-NN is a lazy learner while K-Means is an eager learner. \nK-NN performs much better if all of the data have the same scale but this is not true for K-means.', 'K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm, while K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm.', 'K mean clustering unsupervised aur KNN supervised learning ki technique hy', 'K-Means Clustering is a method for partitioning a dataset into K clusters by minimizing the distance between points within a cluster and maximizing the distance between points in different clusters. KNN is a method for classification or regression based on the K nearest neighbors to a given point.']"

It's more likely categorical. So, a better option would be to use classification models, e.g., random forest models with regressor as the output is a continuous variable. \n\nFurther, the R2 value for linear regression = 0.09 means that the relationship/correlation between input and output data is positive, and an input variable change (1%) causes just a 9% change in the y-variable which is a very weak correlation. Similarly, for SVR, R2=-0.03 follows the same explanation. \n\nWhereas, as support to the use of the Decision trees model, Decision tree regression gives a strong correlation value of -0.61.

The European health insurance in ANY country does not cover a pre existing health condition and I speak that by experience bcuz I have been on one of their scholarships and fell sick during my studies.\nFor example if you sick during your program no matter how severe that is the insurance will cover that. HOWEVER if there is sufficient prove and your medical history of that condition even ONE day before your insurance starts then they are not going to pay for it.

JUkIBWFc3A0,"[""Well done - but explanation about the background knowledge is a bit confusing. here are my thoughts: \n\nBackground knowledge in the context of data mining refers to any prior information or understanding about the domain, data, or problem at hand that can be used to inform and improve the data mining process. It's essentially the context or additional information that the data analyst brings to the table.\n\nTask primitives are the basic types of tasks that can be performed in data mining, such as classification, regression, clustering, and association analysis. Background knowledge is important for these primitives because it can guide the selection of relevant data, the choice of appropriate mining methods, and the interpretation of results.\n\nFor example, suppose a retail company wants to perform a classification task to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their browsing history on the company's website. Here, background knowledge could include:\n\nDemographic Information: Knowing the age, gender, and location of the customer could inform how different groups of customers behave differently.\nSeasonal Patterns: Understanding that certain products are more likely to be purchased during specific seasons (like winter coats in the fall).\nMarket Trends: Being aware of current trends in consumer electronics if the company sells tech products.\nPast Purchase Behavior: Data on what the same customer has bought in the past.\nProduct Relationships: Knowledge that certain products are often bought together, like smartphones and protective cases.\n\nWith this background knowledge, the data mining process is better informed. For instance, the algorithm can be tailored to take into account that a customer who recently bought a high-end camera may also be interested in purchasing photography accessories. This helps in not only preparing the data better (feature selection) but also in interpreting the results of the data mining task more accurately."", 'Maam apka train chut rha hai kya ?

It's important to note that the choice of 1.5 times the IQR is somewhat arbitrary and can be adjusted based on the specific context and requirements of the analysis. Some analyses may use different multiplier values (e.g., 1.0, 2.0) depending on the dataset and the desired level of sensitivity to outliers. Consider how sensitive you want your outlier detection to be. A smaller multiplier will flag fewer data points as outliers, while a larger multiplier will be more sensitive and flag more points."", 'From your explanation of variance and standard deviation, and covariance and correlation, it looks like there is a striking similarity between these two sets of variables.

You mentioned axis=0 means columns and axis=1 means rows. However, in the documentation, it mentions axis=0 means rows and axis=1 means columns. But the behavior of some functions such as min,max,sum,mean,std,var doesn't follow the convention of documentation. The reason for that is: the default behavior of these methods is to calculate these values for each column. This is because the columns are the features or variables in the dataset, and it is often more useful to know these values for each feature than these values for each row. But if you see other functions such as np.append or np.unique, here axis=0 indeed means rows. Besides, in pandas we always use index as axis=0 and columns as axis=1. Thought to point this out!

Hence, if we want the variance of Y to be equal to the variance of X, then the term nVar(Wi) should be equal to 1. Hence, the variance of the weight should be:\r\nVar(Wi)=1/n(input)\n\r\nThis is Xavier Initialization formula. We need to pick the weights from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a variance of 1n where n is the number of input neurons in the weight tensor.. That is how Xavier (Glorot) initialization is implemented in Caffee library.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if we go through backpropagation, we apply the same steps and get:\r\nVar(Wi)=1/n(out)\n\r\nIn order to keep the variance of the input and the output gradient the same, these two constraints can only be satisfied simultaneously if n(input)=n(output). However, in the general case, the n(input) and n(output) of a layer may not be equal, and so as a sort of compromise, Glorot and Bengio suggest using the average of the n(input) and n(output), proposing that:\r\nVar(Wi)=1/n(avg)\r\nwhere n(avg)=(n(input)+n(out))/2.\r\n\r\nSo, the idea is to initialize weights from Gaussian Distribution with mean = 0.0 and variance:\r\nσ=√(2/(n(input)+n(output))\n\r\nNote that when the number of input connections is roughly equal to the number of output connections, you get the simpler equations:\r\nσ^2=1/n(input)', 'Sir I  am not getting better or equal results performing initialization setting the weights manually and setting  them using kernel initializer', 'Outstanding effort for everyone especially for me like new students.

Instead of trying to model the relationship between these variables as a single, complex equation, an additive model would break it down into three separate, simple relationships: the relationship between temperature and crop yield, the relationship between rainfall and crop yield, and the relationship between temperature and rainfall.

Let\'s explain precision, recall, and specificity in simple terms:\n\nPrecision: Imagine you have a toy box with different colored balls. Precision is like how good you are at picking out the right colored balls from the box. If you say, ""I will only pick blue balls,"" and you only pick blue balls from the box, then you have high precision. But if you pick some balls that are not blue, then your precision is not as good.\n\nRecall: Now, let\'s say you want to find all the blue balls in the toy box. Recall is like how many of the blue balls you can find. If you search the box and find all the blue balls, then you have high recall. But if you miss some blue balls and don\'t find them, then your recall is not as good.\n\nSpecificity: Let\'s imagine you have a special rule that says, ""I won\'t pick any red balls."" Specificity is like how good you are at following that rule. If you only pick balls that are not red, then you have high specificity. But if you accidentally pick some red balls, then your specificity is not as good.\n\nSo, precision is about how good you are at picking the right things, recall is about how many of the right things you can find, and specificity is about how good you are at avoiding the wrong things. These are important things to measure when we want to know how well a model can do its job of classifying things correctly.']"

Cheers', 'Good video mate.', 'Million Dollar Potential in Ruvol\n\nI have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting than CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”  \n\nOver time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” \n\nWhy am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It’s for this reason I invented Ruvol where every game is always challenging and exciting to play.\n\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED?\n\nRuvol is played somewhat like chess. I purposely invented Ruvol to give chess a direct “apple-to-apple” competition.  \n\nLike chess, Ruvol is played by two players.  It uses a board that is rectangular in shape but containing more number of squares than chess.  Like chess, it has equal number of pieces on each side of the board, where each type of piece moves in distinct ways.  However, if the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent’s king, the way to win Ruvol is to be able to cross a designated line.  \n\nBut there’s one biggest advantage Ruvol has over chess that makes Ruvol a very challenging game to play.  What is this?  Unlike chess, the Ruvol pieces are randomly placed at the start of every game which makes it impossible for any clever player to memorize the moves.  Fischer Random Chess, also known as Chess960, likewise introduced a random set up, but with many exceptions.  Ruvol is 100% random.\n\nAt present, there is no other board game in the world within the same category of chess “where chess players can switch to.”  Chess is totally a monopoly in its class.  With the coming of Ruvol, chess has finally found its match!\n\nA MILLION DOLLAR POTENTIAL IN RUVOL\n\nIn my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  These 800 million players comprise the “Total Potential Buyers” of Ruvol across the globe.  At an average profit of just US$3 per set, the “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol then is US$2.4 billion.  Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale of Ruvol is US$24M.\n\nI AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL.  \n\nFor the reason that I don’t have the resources to publish Ruvol on a global scale, I find it “wiser” to simply sell my copyright.  \n\nIf you’re interested to buy my copyright, email me your BEST PRICE OFFER—[the copyright goes to the most reasonable bid].  My email address is:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   [Or perhaps you can help me find a buyer, and I’ll reward you with a commission.]\n\nThanks and God bless!\n \nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\nThe Ruvol Inventor\n\nEarly bird catches the worm!', 'Hi Keith great video.

Validate the score performance seen in step 1 via cross-validation and pick the best performing model (thinking: It could be that a model that is best in train_test_split, is not the best model when running cross-validation. >>> this is from video 8.2\n\n3. Take the best model (let’s say it’s Random Forest) and perform Grid Search via hyperparameter tuning as you explained in this video.

-77EvEjuZJY,"['Apart from gpt4 llms what aother free LLMS we can use multipmodel?', 'can you please cover video processing', ""›⟩ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God's Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say 'heart', I mean 'spirit'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God's Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won't last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

In production the ingestion and storage need to be done before hand with pesistence.  The trick is here is how to store the text/table partition_pdf data as regular text inside a non-vector database with a matched search like FTS5 to get relevant documents which then can be used with the summarization and the vectordb to produce the result.  the langchain examples, not just this one, always just load the entire context into memory which basically means there is no FT search, it's just a dump and with presumed data formats.

Kinda like taking a picture of a picture, and then taking a picture of THAT picture... eventually the image will be so degraded you'll start misinterpret what exactly is in the picture.\nWhen ChatGPT starts going off the rails, and i start a fresh chat, and only provide the new bot the last version of my code, it works perfectly normal again.\n\nFor example, I ask chatGPT to make a change to the code, and suddenly it starts doing totally different things even though my prompt is super detailed. It has started to confuse things I said and asked 3 days ago (same thread) and mix it in with my current request.\n\nSo deducting from that, I would interpret the main problem with AI currently is that it is bad at decerning what information in memory is relevant enough to keep, or which info is obsolete. - The user should thus actually be given the tools to decide which data the AI has to forget or disregard.\n\nNow that I think about it, one time I told it to forget everything we did up until that point and I would provide it with the current, active live code we're working on, repeated several times in different wording to completely disregard everything before 'this' prompt,.
